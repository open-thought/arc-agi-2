SOLUTION found for 00576224 at index 692.
output: To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the input-output pairs:

1. The output matrix is always a square matrix with a size that is twice the size of the input matrix along the diagonal (i.e., the output size is 2 * input_size + 2).

2. The output matrix is created by repeating the rows of the input matrix in a zigzag pattern.

Applying these rules to the given input3:

input3: 2x2
[[3,2],
 [7,8]]

Step 1: Calculate the output size
Output size = 2 * input_size + 2 = 2 * 2 + 2 = 6

Step 2: Create the output matrix by repeating the rows in a zigzag pattern
Output0:
[[8,6,8,6,8,6],
 [6,4,6,4,6,4],
 [6,8,6,8,6,8],
 [4,6,4,6,4,6],
 [8,6,8,6,8,6],
 [6,4,6,4,6,4]]

Output1:
[[7,9,7,9,7,9],
 [4,3,4,3,4,3],
 [9,7,9,7,9,7],
 [3,4,3,4,3,4],
 [7,9,7,9,7,9],
 [4,3,4,3,4,3]]

Following the same pattern for input3:

Output3:
[[3,2,3,2,3,2],
 [7,8,7,8,7,8],
 [2,3,2,3,2,3],
 [8,7,8,7,8,7],
 [3,2,3,2,3,2],
 [7,8,7,8,7,8]]

Therefore, the output for input3 is:
[[3,2,3,2,3,2],
 [7,8,7,8,7,8],
 [2,3,2,3,2,3],
 [8,7,8,7,8,7],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The first row and the first column of the output matrix are the same as the first row and first column of the input matrix, respectively.
2. The second row of the output matrix is a shifted version of the second row of the input matrix. The elements are shifted one position to the right, and the last element (0) is moved to the first position.
3. The third row of the output matrix is a shifted version of the third row of the input matrix, similar to the second row.
4. For the remaining rows (4th and onwards), the output matrix copies the elements from the 2nd row of the input matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the output for the given input6:

input6: 10x7
[[5,0,4,4,4,0,0],

output: Based on the given input-output pairs, the transformation rule seems to be:

For each input, find the value that appears most frequently in the interior of the matrix (excluding the first and last rows and columns). This value will be the single element in the corresponding output.

Let's apply this rule to the given input6:

input6: 11x13
[[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0],
[1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,7,1,1,1],
[1,1,1,3,3,1,1,1,1,7,1,1,1],
[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0],
[6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,6,6,6],
[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0]]

The most frequent value in the interior (excluding the first and last rows and columns) is 7.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input6 is:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. input0: 5x5, output0: 1x1
   The output is always 0 if there are no 8's in the top-left 2x2 submatrix.

2. input1: 5x7, output1: 1x1
   The output is 8 if there are 8's in all 5 rows in the rightmost column.

3. input2: 6x7, output2: 1x1
   The output is 8 if there are 8's in all 6 rows in the rightmost column.

4. input3: 6x7, output3: 1x1
   The output is 0 if there are no 8's in the rightmost column.

5. input4: 6x7, output4: 1x1
   The output is 8 if there are 8's in all 6 rows in the rightmost column.

6. input5: 6x6, output5: 1x1
   The output is 0 if there are no 8's in the rightmost column.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule for input7:

The output is 8 if there are 8's in all 8 rows in the rightmost column. Since there are 8's in all 8 rows in the rightmost column of input7, the corresponding output for input7 is:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input0: [[5,5,0],
        [5,0,5],
        [0,5,0]]

Output0: [[1]]

Input1: [[8,0,8],
        [0,8,0],
        [8,0,8]]

Output1: [[2]]

Input2: [[5,0,5],
        [0,5,0],
        [5,0,5]]

Output2: [[2]]

Input3: [[0,1,1],
        [0,1,1],
        [1,0,0]]

Output3: [[3]]

Input4: [[0,8,8],
        [0,8,8],
        [8,0,0]]

Output4: [[3]]

Input5: [[4,4,0],
        [4,0,4],
        [0,4,0]]

Output5: [[1]]

Input6: [[0,5,0],
        [5,5,5],
        [0,5,0]]

Output6: [[6]]

From the given examples, we can observe the following:

1. The output is always a 1x1 matrix.
2. The output value seems to be related to the number of non-zero elements in the input matrix.
3. If there is only one non-zero element in the input matrix, the output is 1.
4. If there are two non-zero elements in the input matrix, the output is 2.
5. If there are three non-zero elements in the input matrix, the output is 3.
6. If there are four non-zero elements in the input matrix, the output is 1.
7. If there are five non-zero elements in the input matrix, the output is 6.

Based on this pattern, for the given input8:

Input8: [[0,8,0],
        [8,8,8],
        [0,8,0]]

There are five non-zero elements in the input matrix. According to the observed pattern, when there are five non-zero elements, the output is 6.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is:

Output8: [[6]]
expected: [[6]]

SOLUTION found for 29c11459 at index 1100.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to be applying a pattern to the non-zero elements in each row.
2. In input0, the non-zero elements are 1 and 2. In the output, they are replaced by 1 and a sequence of 5's followed by 2's.
3. In input1, the non-zero elements are 3 and 7. In the output, they are replaced by 3 and a sequence of 5's followed by 7's.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. If the non-zero element is less than 5, replace it with the same value.
2. If the non-zero element is greater than or equal to 5, replace it with a sequence of 5's followed by the original non-zero element.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input3:

input3: 5x11
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9]]

Applying the transformation rule:

1. In the second row, 4 is less than 5, so it remains unchanged.
2. In the second row, 8 is greater than or equal to 5, so it is replaced by a sequence of 5's followed by 8.
3. In the fifth row, 6 is less than 5, so it remains unchanged.
4. In the fifth row, 9 is greater than or equal to 5, so it is replaced by a sequence of 5's followed by 9.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0: 3x9
Output0: 3x3
- Each row in the output is a subsequence of the corresponding row in the input, starting from the beginning and ending at the 3rd element from the end.

Input1: 4x12
Output1: 4x4
- Each row in the output is a subsequence of the corresponding row in the input, starting from the beginning and ending at the 3rd element from the end.

Input2: 2x6
Output2: 2x2
- Each row in the output is a subsequence of the corresponding row in the input, starting from the beginning and ending at the 2nd element from the end.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for the given input4:

Input4: 5x15
Output4: 5x5
- Each row in the output will be a subsequence of the corresponding row in the input, starting from the beginning and ending at the 4th element from the end.

Applying this rule to the input4:

SOLUTION found for 332efdb3 at index 906.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output board always starts and ends with a row/column of all 1s.
2. The middle rows/columns alternate between all 1s and a pattern where 1s are separated by 0s.
3. The number of 0s between 1s in the middle rows/columns is always 1 less than the size of the board.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

For a board of size n x n:
1. The first and last rows/columns should be filled with 1s.
2. For the remaining rows/columns, alternate between filling all cells with 1s and filling cells with 1s, separated by a single 0.

Applying this rule to the given input4 (11x11 board):

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output size is always 5x5, regardless of the input size.
2. The output contains the highest value (7, 8, 6, or 2) in the corresponding top-left 3x3 submatrix of the input.
3. The output is symmetric along the central column.
4. The output has a specific pattern around the central value, which depends on the input values.

Let's apply these observations to the last input example (input5) to deduce the corresponding output.

Deduced Output5:
1. The top-left 3x3 submatrix contains values 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.
   The highest value is 1, so the central value in the output should be 1.
2. The output is symmetric along the central column.
3. The output pattern around the central value (1) is:
   [[1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,0,1,0,1],
    [1,1,1,1,1],
    [1,0,1,0,1],

Therefore, the corresponding output for input5 is:

SOLUTION found for 3979b1a8 at index 967.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

Observations:
1. The output is always a square matrix with a side length that is twice the input matrix's side length.
2. The outermost ring of the output matrix consists of the input values in a mirrored pattern.
3. The inner region of the output matrix is filled with increasing values from the center outwards, with a pattern that depends on the input values.

Let's focus on the inner region of the output matrix. We can see that the values increase from the center outwards, and the pattern of increase depends on the input values.

For example, in the first input-output pair:
- The input values are 2 and 9.
- In the output, the inner region is filled with increasing values from 2 to 9, and then back to 2.

Similarly, in the second input-output pair:
- The input values are 2 and 5.
- In the output, the inner region is filled with increasing values from 2 to 5, and then back to 2.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for the given input3:

input3: 5x5
[[5,1,1,1,5],
[1,1,9,1,1],
[1,9,9,9,1],
[1,1,9,1,1],
[5,1,1,1,5]]

output3: 10x10

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9],
[9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1]]

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Create a square output matrix with a side length twice that of the input matrix.
2. Fill the outermost ring of the output matrix with the input values in a mirrored pattern.
3. For the inner region of the output matrix, fill the cells with increasing values from the center outwards.
   - If the input values are a and b (a < b), the inner region will have values increasing from a to b, and then back to a.
   - The pattern of increase depends on the input values a and b. In this case, the pattern is linear, but it could be different for other inputs.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The input matrix is filled with a constant value (e.g., 6, 5, 8, 3) except for a single non-zero value at the center.
2. In the output matrix, the constant value gradually increases from the center towards the edges, forming a gradient pattern.
3. The magnitude of the increase depends on the size of the input matrix. In the given examples:
   - For a 15x15 matrix, the increase is by 1 (e.g., 6 to 7, 7 to 8, etc.).
   - For a 3x3 matrix, the increase is by 2 (e.g., 5 to 7, 7 to 9, etc.).
   - For a 7x7 matrix, the increase is by 2 (e.g., 8 to 10, 10 to 12, etc.).

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for the given 10x10 input matrix:

input4: 10x10
[[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Output:
The output matrix will have a gradient pattern similar to the previous examples. The increase in value will be by 2, as the input matrix is 10x10.

SOLUTION found for 445eab21 at index 961.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a 2x2 square containing the highest value present in the corresponding input.
2. The highest value in the input is determined by the connected component with the most occurrences of a non-zero value.
3. The connected components are formed by the non-zero values that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to each other.

Applying these observations to the last input example (input4):

Input4:
[[3,3,3,3,3,0,9,9,9,9],
 [3,0,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,9],
 [3,0,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,9],
 [3,0,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,9],
 [3,0,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,9],
 [3,0,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,9],
 [3,0,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,9],
 [3,0,0,0,3,0,9,0,0,9],
 [3,3,3,3,3,0,9,0,0,9],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9,9,9]]

The connected components and their occurrences of non-zero values are:
- Component 1 (value 3): 25 occurrences
- Component 2 (value 9): 20 occurrences

The connected component with the most occurrences is Component 1 (value 3) with 25 occurrences.

Therefore, the output for input4 should be a 2x2 square containing the value 3:

Output4: [[3,3],
          [3,3]]
expected: [[3,3],
[3,3]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input0: [[2,0,2],
        [0,2,0],
        [2,0,2]]

Output0: [[1]]

Input1: [[2,0,0],
        [2,0,0],
        [0,2,0]]

Output1: [[7]]

Input2: [[2,0,2],
        [2,0,2],

Output2: [[1]]

Input3: [[0,0,0],

Output3: [[1]]

Input4: [[2,2,0],
        [0,2,2],
        [0,0,0]]

Output4: [[7]]

Input5: [[2,2,0],
        [0,2,0],
        [0,0,0]]

Output5: [[7]]

Now, let's consider the last input example:

Input7: [[2,0,2],
        [2,2,2],
        [2,0,2]]

To deduce the corresponding output, we can compare this input with the previous inputs and their outputs.

Input0 and Input7 have the same pattern of 2s and 0s, but Input7 has a 2 in the center of the bottom row, while Input0 has a 0 there. The output for Input0 is [[1]], so the output for Input7 should be different.

Input1, Input4, and Input5 all have a sum of 4 in the center of the matrix. The output for these inputs is [[7]].

Since Input7 also has a sum of 4 in the center, it seems that the output for Input7 should also be [[7]].

Therefore, the deduced output for Input7 is:

Output7: [[7]]
expected: [[1]]

 [0,0,0,0]]

Output1:
[[5,0,0,6],
 [0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0],
 [8,0,0,3]]

Observations:
1. The non-zero elements in the input matrix are moved to the top-left corner of the output matrix.
2. The non-zero elements in the output matrix are in the same relative order as in the input matrix.
3. The non-zero elements in the output matrix are surrounded by zeros.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. Create an empty output matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix.
2. For each non-zero element in the input matrix, place it in the top-left corner of the output matrix, maintaining its relative order.
3. Fill the remaining positions in the output matrix with zeros.

Applying this rule to the last input example:

Input3:
[[0,0,0,0],

 [0,0,0,0]]

Output3:
[[2,0,0,3],
 [0,0,0,0],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output matrix has three distinct regions: a central region with value 5, and two outer regions with value 0.
2. The central region always contains the maximum value in the input matrix.
3. The output matrix's dimensions are flipped compared to the input matrix.
4. The position of the maximum value in the input matrix determines the position of the central region in the output matrix.

Now, let's apply these observations to the last input example:

input6: 3x3
[[4,4,4],
[2,3,2],
[3,2,3]]

Step 1: Find the maximum value in the input matrix.
The maximum value is 4, which appears in the first row and third column.

Step 2: Determine the position of the central region in the output matrix.
Since the maximum value is in the first row and third column, the central region of the output matrix will be in the second row and fourth column.

Step 3: Construct the output matrix based on the observations.
The output matrix will have dimensions 3x3 (flipped from the input matrix), with the central region containing the maximum value (5) and the outer regions containing the value 0.

output6: 3x3
[[0,0,5],
[0,5,0],
[5,0,0]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for the given input6 is:
output6: 3x3
[[0,0,5],
[0,5,0],
[5,0,0]]
expected: [[0,0,5],
[0,5,0],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output matrix is always symmetric along the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.
2. The top-left and bottom-right corners of the output matrix are always filled with 8.
3. The middle row of the output matrix always has 0 in the middle element, and the rest of the elements are 8.
4. The number of rows and columns in the output matrix is always one more than the corresponding dimension of the input matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the output for the given input5:

input5: 7x6
[[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],

[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,8,8,8,8,8]]

The transformation rule can be summarized as follows:
1. The output matrix dimensions are (n+1) x (m+1), where n and m are the dimensions of the input matrix.
2. The top-left and bottom-right corners of the output matrix are filled with 8.
3. The middle row of the output matrix has 0 in the middle element, and the rest of the elements are 8.
4. The output matrix is symmetric along the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input matrix:
1. The first and last rows are identical.
2. The second row is repeated twice in the output.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the output for the given input5:

input5: 3x3

output5: 6x3
[[2,9,2],
[8,5,2],
[2,2,8],
[2,2,8],
[8,5,2],
[2,9,2]]

The first and last rows of input5 are identical, so they are repeated in the output5. The second row is repeated twice in the output5 as well.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a 3x3 matrix.
2. The top-left element of the output is always 2.
3. All other elements in the first row and first column of the output are 0.
4. If there is a 1 in the input matrix, the corresponding element in the output matrix is either 0 or 2, depending on the position of the 1.
5. If there are multiple 1s in the input matrix, the corresponding elements in the output matrix are all 2.

Now, let's apply these observations to the last input example:

input11: 3x3
[[0,1,0],
[0,0,0],
[0,1,0]]

1. The output will be a 3x3 matrix.
2. The top-left element of the output will be 2.
3. The first row and first column of the output will have elements 0.

The only remaining elements to determine are the ones in the second row and third column. Since there are two 1s in the input matrix, all corresponding elements in the output matrix will be 2.

Therefore, the output for input11 will be:

output11: 3x3

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input, we can observe the following:
1. The output is always twice the size of the input along the first dimension (width).
2. The elements in the output are copied vertically from the input, and then repeated horizontally.
3. The elements in the last column of the output are always the same as the elements in the last column of the input.

Applying these observations to the last input example:

input4: 3x3
[[0,0,0],

Step 1: Double the width of the input.
output4: 6x3
[[?,?,?],

[?,?,?]]

Step 2: Copy the elements from the input vertically and fill the first three columns.
output4: 6x3
[[0,0,0],
[0,0,1],
[1,0,0],
[1,0,0],
[0,0,1],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a 3x3 matrix.
2. The output matrix has a central value of 8, surrounded by 8s on the sides and 0s on the corners.
3. The input matrix is always a 7x7 matrix.
4. The input matrix has a pattern where the central row and column are filled with non-zero values, while the outer row and column have mostly zeros.
5. The non-zero values in the input matrix seem to be shifted by one position compared to the output matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. Identify the central 5x5 submatrix in the input matrix.
2. Mirror the central 5x5 submatrix horizontally and vertically to create a 7x7 matrix.
3. Replace the original non-zero values in the central row and column of the 7x7 matrix with zeros.
4. Create a 3x3 output matrix by extracting the central 3x3 submatrix from the modified 7x7 matrix.
5. Set the central value of the output matrix to 8, and the surrounding values to 8 if they were originally non-zero in the input matrix, or to 0 otherwise.

Applying this transformation rule to the given input8:

input8: 7x7
[[0,0,8,1,1,0,1],
[5,1,1,0,1,1,0],
[0,1,0,1,0,0,1],
[1,0,2,0,0,6,0],
[6,0,1,1,5,0,0],
[0,0,3,0,0,0,5],
[0,1,0,0,2,0,1]]

Step 1: Identify the central 5x5 submatrix
[[1,1,8,1,1],
 [1,0,1,0,1],
 [0,1,0,1,0],
 [2,0,0,6,0],
 [1,1,5,0,0],
 [3,0,0,0,5]]

Step 2: Mirror the central 5x5 submatrix horizontally and vertically
[[1,1,8,1,1],
 [1,0,1,0,1],
 [0,1,0,1,0],
 [2,0,0,6,0],
 [1,1,5,0,0],
 [3,0,0,0,5]]

Step 3: Replace the original non-zero values in the central row and column with zeros
[[0,1,8,0,1],
 [1,0,1,0,1],
 [0,1,0,1,0],
 [0,0,0,6,0],
 [1,1,5,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,5]]

Step 4: Create a 3x3 output matrix by extracting the central 3x3 submatrix
[[8,0,1],
 [0,1,0],
 [5,0,5]]

Step 5: Set the central value to 8 and the surrounding values to 8 if they were originally non-zero in the input matrix, or to 0 otherwise
[[0,0,8],
 [8,8,0],
 [0,8,0]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is:
output8: 3x3
[[0,0,8],
 [8,8,0],
 [0,8,0]]
expected: [[0,0,8],
[8,8,0],
[0,8,0]]

output: To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs:

1. The input size is always increased by doubling the number of columns.
   - input0: 5x6 -> output0: 5x12
   - input1: 5x7 -> output1: 5x14
   - input2: 5x8 -> output2: 5x16

2. The pattern in each row is repeated twice in the output, with a gap of one column between repetitions.
   - input0: [2,8,2,8,2,8] -> output0: [2,8,2,8,2,8,2,8,2,8,2,8]
   - input1: [2,3,3,2,3,3,2] -> output1: [2,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,2,3]
   - input2: [1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2] -> output2: [1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2]

Based on these observations, the transformation rule for the given input4 can be deduced as follows:

1. Double the number of columns: 5x9 -> 5x18
2. Repeat each row pattern twice, with a gap of one column between repetitions.

Applying the transformation rule to input4:

input4: 5x9

output: To determine the output for the given input4, let's analyze the patterns in the provided input/output pairs.

Input0 to Output0:
- The value 2 in the input is replaced by a repeating pattern of 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5.
- The value 6 in the input is replaced by a repeating pattern of 6, 5, 6, 5, 6.

Input1 to Output1:
- The value 2 in the input is replaced by the same pattern as in Output0.
- The value 3 in the input is replaced by a repeating pattern of 3, 5, 3, 5, 3.
- The value 6 in the input is replaced by the same pattern as in Output0.

Input2 to Output2:
- The value 8 in the input is replaced by a repeating pattern of 8, 5, 8, 5.

Based on these patterns, we can deduce the output for input4:

Output4: 9x8
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,3,5,3,5,3],
[0,0,4,5,4,5,4,5],

[0,0,0,2,5,2,5,2],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

The values 3, 4, and 2 in the input are replaced by the same patterns as in the previous examples. The value 8 in the input is replaced by the pattern 8, 5, 8, 5, which is consistent with the pattern observed in Output2.

output: To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the input and output pairs.

Observations:
1. The input and output matrices are the same size (16x16).
2. The values in each row of the output matrix are a circular shift of the values in the corresponding row of the input matrix.
3. The shift amount for each row is determined by the value in the top-left corner of that row in the input matrix.

Let's define the transformation rule:
- For each row in the input matrix, shift the values in that row to the right by the number of positions equal to the value in the top-left corner of that row.
- If the shift amount is greater than the length of the row, the values wrap around from the end of the row to the beginning.

Applying this rule to the last input example:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input0: 6x6
Output0: 2x2
The output is the top-left 2x2 submatrix of the input.

Input1: 8x8
Output1: 2x2
The output is the top-left 2x2 submatrix of the input.

Input2: 12x6
Output2: 2x2
The output is the top-left 2x2 submatrix of the input.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to extract the top-left 2x2 submatrix from the input matrix.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input4:

Input4: 4x8
[[9,6,2,9,9,2,6,9],
 [2,9,9,6,6,9,9,2],
 [6,9,9,2,2,9,9,6],
 [9,2,6,9,9,6,2,9]]

The top-left 2x2 submatrix is:
[[9,6],
 [2,9]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
Output4: 2x2
[[9,6],
 [2,9]]
expected: [[9,6],
[2,9]]

SOLUTION found for 00576224 at index 671.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

For each element in the input matrix, the corresponding elements in the output matrix follow a specific pattern:

1. The top-left element of the input matrix (I or H) is replicated in the first row and first column of the output matrix.
2. The top-right element of the input matrix (G or J) is replicated in the second row and second column of the output matrix.
3. The bottom-left element of the input matrix (E or D) is replicated in the third row and third column of the output matrix.
4. The bottom-right element of the input matrix (G or J) is replicated in the fourth row and fourth column of the output matrix.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the given input3:

input3: 2x2
[[D,C],
[H,I]]

output3: 6x6
[[D,C,D,C,D,C],
[H,I,H,I,H,I],
[C,D,C,D,C,D],
[I,H,I,H,I,H],
[D,C,D,C,D,C],
[H,I,H,I,H,I]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input3 is:
[[D,C,D,C,D,C],
[H,I,H,I,H,I],
[C,D,C,D,C,D],
[I,H,I,H,I,H],
[D,C,D,C,D,C],
[H,I,H,I,H,I]]
expected: [[D,C,D,C,D,C],
[H,I,H,I,H,I],
[C,D,C,D,C,D],
[I,H,I,H,I,H],
[D,C,D,C,D,C],
[H,I,H,I,H,I]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns or similarities in the input patterns that consistently lead to the same output pattern.

Input 0:
[[A,A,I,A,I],
[C,C,I,A,A],
[C,C,A,A,I],
[A,A,A,C,C],
[I,I,A,C,C]]

Output 0:
[[A]]

Input 1:
[[A,I,A,A,A,A,A],
[C,C,A,I,I,I,A],
[C,C,I,I,A,C,C],
[A,A,I,A,A,C,C],
[A,I,A,A,I,A,A]]

Output 1:
[[I]]

Input 2:
[[I,C,C,I,I,A,A],
[A,C,C,A,A,A,I],
[A,I,I,A,A,I,A],
[A,A,I,A,A,A,I],
[I,A,I,I,I,C,C],
[I,A,A,A,A,C,C]]

Output 2:
[[I]]

Input 3:
[[I,I,A,A,C,C,A],
[A,I,I,A,C,C,I],
[A,A,A,I,A,I,A],
[I,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,C,C,A,I,A,I],
[A,C,C,I,I,A,I]]

Output 3:
[[A]]

Input 4:
[[I,A,A,A,A,I,A],
[A,A,C,C,A,I,A],
[I,A,C,C,A,A,A],
[A,A,I,A,A,I,A],
[A,A,I,C,C,A,I],
[I,A,A,C,C,I,A]]

Output 4:
[[I]]

Input 5:
[[I,A,A,C,C,I],
[I,A,I,C,C,A],
[A,A,A,A,I,A],
[C,C,I,A,I,A],
[C,C,A,A,A,I],
[A,I,I,A,I,A]]

Output 5:
[[A]]

Now, let's consider the last input example:
Input 7:
[[C,C,I,I,A,I],
[C,C,A,I,A,A],
[I,I,A,A,A,I],
[A,I,I,I,A,A],
[I,A,I,A,A,I],
[A,A,I,C,C,A],
[I,A,A,C,C,A],
[A,I,A,A,A,I]]

To determine the output for this input, we can look for similar patterns in the input matrix that match the outputs of the previous examples.

In this case, the input matrix has the following pattern:
- The top-left 2x2 submatrix is [[C,C,I,I]].
- The top-right 2x2 submatrix is [[A,I,A,A]].
- The bottom-left 2x2 submatrix is [[A,I,I,I]].
- The bottom-right 2x2 submatrix is [[A,A,I,C]].

This pattern is similar to the input matrix of example 3, which had the output [[A]].

Therefore, based on the observed patterns, the output for input 7 should be:
Output 7: [[A]]
expected: [[I]]

SOLUTION found for 29c11459 at index 938.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For input0:
- The 'B' in the second row is replaced by 'B' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'C' in the second row is replaced by 'C' and 'F' in the output.
- All other 'A's remain unchanged.

For input1:
- The 'D' in the fourth row is replaced by 'D' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'H' in the fourth row is replaced by 'H' and 'F' in the output.
- All other 'A's remain unchanged.

Now, let's apply the observed patterns to the last input example (input3):

input3: 5x11
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[E,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,I],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[G,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,J]]

Applying the transformation rule:
- The 'E' in the second row should be replaced by 'E' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'I' in the second row should be replaced by 'I' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'G' in the fourth row should be replaced by 'G' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'J' in the fourth row should be replaced by 'J' and 'F' in the output.
- All other 'A's remain unchanged.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input3 is:

output3: 5x11
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[E,E,E,E,E,F,I,I,I,I,I],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[G,G,G,G,G,F,J,J,J,J,J]]
expected: [[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[E,E,E,E,E,F,I,I,I,I,I],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns.

Example 1:
input0: 3x9
[[E,F,B,B,F,E,E,F,B],
 [F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F],
 [B,F,E,E,F,B,B,F,E]]

output0: 3x3
[[E,F,B],
 [F,F,F],
 [B,F,E]]

Observations:
1. The output is always a square matrix (3x3 in this case).
2. The output matrix is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, and finally the third row of the input matrix.
3. The output matrix is cropped from the left side of the input matrix.

Example 2:
input1: 4x12
[[C,A,A,B,C,A,A,B,C,A,A,B],
 [E,C,B,E,E,C,B,E,E,C,B,E],
 [E,B,C,E,E,B,C,E,E,B,C,E],
 [B,A,A,C,B,A,A,C,B,A,A,C]]

output1: 4x4
[[C,A,A,B],
 [E,C,B,E],
 [E,B,C,E],
 [B,A,A,C]]

Observations:
1. The output is always a square matrix (4x4 in this case).
2. The output matrix is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, and finally the third row of the input matrix.
3. The output matrix is cropped from the left side of the input matrix.

Example 3:
input2: 2x6
[[C,B,C,B,C,B],
 [C,D,C,D,C,D]]

output2: 2x2
[[C,B],
 [C,D]]

Observations:
1. The output is always a square matrix (2x2 in this case).
2. The output matrix is formed by taking the first row, then the second row of the input matrix.
3. The output matrix is cropped from the left side of the input matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. The output matrix size is determined by the number of rows in the input matrix (e.g., 3x3 for a 3-row input, 4x4 for a 4-row input, and 2x2 for a 2-row input).
2. The output matrix is formed by taking the first row, then the second row, and so on, until all rows are used.
3. The output matrix is cropped from the left side of the input matrix, taking the number of columns equal to the number of rows in the output matrix.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input4:

input4: 5x15
[[A,C,A,E,E,A,C,A,E,E,A,C,A,E,E],
 [C,C,A,E,E,C,C,A,E,E,C,C,A,E,E],

 [B,B,A,C,A,B,B,A,C,A,B,B,A,C,A]]

Output for input4:
1. The output matrix size will be 5x5 (square matrix) since the input has 5 rows.
2. The output matrix will be formed by taking the first row, then the second row, and so on, until all rows are used.
3. The output matrix will be cropped from the left side of the input matrix, taking the number of columns equal to the number of rows in the output matrix (5 columns).

output: To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. For a 7x7 grid:
   - The central 'A' in each row and column is replaced by 'B'.
   - All other 'A's remain unchanged.

2. For a 5x5 grid:
   - The central 'A' in each row and column is replaced by 'B'.
   - All other 'A's remain unchanged.

3. For a 9x9 grid:
   - The central 'A' in each row and column is replaced by 'B'.
   - All other 'A's remain unchanged.

From these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:

For any given grid size, the central 'A' in each row and column is replaced by 'B', while all other 'A's remain unchanged.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a single element, either 'B' or 'H'.
2. For inputs where the central element of the middle row is 'C' (input0, input2, input7), the output is 'B'.
3. For inputs where the central element of the middle row is not 'C' (input1, input3, input4, input5), the output is 'H'.
4. The shape of the input matrix does not seem to affect the output.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

If the central element of the middle row is 'C', the output is 'B'.
If the central element of the middle row is not 'C', the output is 'H'.

Applying this rule to the given input7:
[[C,A,C],
[C,C,C],
[C,A,C]]

The central element of the middle row is 'C'. Therefore, according to the rule, the output should be 'B'.

So, the corresponding output for input7 is:
1x1
[[B]]
expected: [[B]]

output: To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

In all cases, the 'A' and 'B' (or 'D' and 'C') characters are symmetrically shifted to the right by one position in the output compared to the input. The 'G' character in the last input example behaves similarly to 'B' (or 'D') in the other examples.

Based on this observation, the output for input4 should be:

output4: 10x10
[[A,A,A,A,G,A,A,A,A,A],

The 'G' character is shifted to the right by one position in each row, while the 'A' characters are shifted to the right by one position in each column.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each pair, we can see that the output is filled with the same letter in each cell. This letter is the one that appears most frequently in the corresponding input.

Let's apply this rule to the last input example:

input4: 3x3
[[I,I,G],
[E,G,J],
[I,D,A]]

Counting the occurrences of each letter:
I: 3
E: 2
G: 2
J: 1
A: 1
D: 1

The letter that appears most frequently is I, with a count of 3. Therefore, the corresponding output for this input should be a 3x3 matrix filled with the letter I.

output4: 3x3
[[I,I,I],
[I,I,I],
[I,I,I]]

So, the transformation rule for the given set of input-output pairs is: the output is a 3x3 matrix filled with the letter that appears most frequently in the corresponding input.

From the given examples, we can see that the output size is always 1x1, regardless of the input size. This suggests that the transformation rule maps each input to a single output value.

Now, let's examine the output values for each input:

- output0: [[C]]
- output1: [[D]]
- output2: [[I]]
- input4:?

To determine the output for input4, we need to find a pattern in the previous inputs that can help us predict the output for this new input. Let's look at the last row of each input:

- input0: [A, A, I, I, A, A, I]
- input1: [A, A, I, I, A, A]
- input2: [A, A, F, F, A, A]
- input4: [A, A, J, J, A, A]

We can see that the last row of input4 is the same as the last row of input0, which outputs [[C]]. Therefore, based on the pattern observed, we can deduce that the output for input4 should be:

output4: [[C]]

In conclusion, the input-to-output transformation rule appears to be mapping each input to a single character, where the character is determined by the last row of the input.
expected: [[C]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. For a 3x3 input:
   - Replace 'A' with 'I' in the first and last row.
   - Replace 'A' with 'A' in the middle row.

2. For a 4x3 input:
   - Replace 'A' with 'I' in the first and last row.
   - Replace 'A' with 'A' in the middle two rows.

3. For a 5x4 input:
   - Replace 'A' with 'I' in the first and last row.

4. For a 5x6 input:
   - Replace 'A' with 'I' in the first and last row.
   - Replace 'A' with 'A' in the middle four rows.

Now, let's apply the observed pattern to the 7x6 input:

input5: 7x6
[[A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A],

[I,A,A,A,A,I],
[I,A,A,A,A,I],
[I,A,A,A,A,I],
[I,I,I,I,I,I]]

The transformation rule for a 7x6 input is:
- Replace 'A' with 'I' in the first and last row.
- Replace 'A' with 'A' in the middle five rows.

SOLUTION found for 6fa7a44f at index 455.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. Each output is twice the size of the corresponding input along the height (number of rows).
2. The first and last rows of the output are always the same as the first and last rows of the input.
3. The middle row(s) of the output are copied and repeated until the output height is double the input height.

Applying these rules to the given input5:

input5: 3x3
[[C,J,C],
[I,F,C],
[C,C,I]]

Step 1: Double the height of the input
output5: 6x3
[[C,J,C],
[I,F,C],
[C,C,I],
[C,C,I],
[I,F,C],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input-output pairs:
1. input0: 4x8, output0: 4x4
2. input1: 3x6, output1: 3x3
3. input2: 6x2, output2: 3x2

Observations:
1. The output size is always half of the input size in both dimensions.
2. The output is always a square matrix, regardless of the input size and shape.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for input4:

input4: 8x3
To find the output size, we divide each dimension of the input by 2:
8 ÷ 2 = 4
3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 (rounded down to 1 since the output size must be an integer)

So, the output size should be 4x1.

Now, let's apply the transformation rule to input4:

input4: 8x3
[[F,E,F],
[E,F,E],
[G,G,E],
[C,G,C],
[F,E,F],
[E,F,E],
[G,G,E],
[C,G,C]]

output4: 4x1
[[F,E,F],
[E,F,E],
[G,G,E],
[C,G,C]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
output4: 4x1
[[F,E,F],
[E,F,E],
[G,G,E],
[C,G,C]]
expected: [[F,E,F],
[E,F,E],
[G,G,E],
[C,G,C]]

SOLUTION found for 8597cfd7 at index 279.
output: To determine the output for input5, let's analyze the pattern in the given input/output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a 2x2 matrix.
2. The output matrix contains the same element as the top-right and bottom-left corners of the input matrix.
3. If the top-right and bottom-left corners are both 'E', the output matrix is [[E, E], [E, E]].

For input5:
Top-right corner: A
Bottom-left corner: A

Since the top-right and bottom-left corners are both 'A', the output matrix will be [[A, A], [A, A]].

Therefore, the corresponding output for input5 is:
output5: 2x2
[[A, A],
 [A, A]]
expected: [[E,E],
[E,E]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a 3x3 matrix.
2. The output matrix has the letter 'A' in the center of each row and column.
3. The letters 'I', 'J', 'E', 'C', and 'D' are used in the output, but not in a consistent pattern.
4. The output matrix seems to be a transformation of the input matrix, but the exact rule is not clear.

Let's try to find a pattern by comparing the input and output matrices:

input0: [[A,E,B,A,A,B,G],
        [A,A,B,A,A,A,A],
        [B,B,A,A,B,B,A],
        [A,B,A,A,A,B,B],

        [B,A,B,A,B,A,H],
        [B,B,B,A,E,B,A]]

output0: [[A,A,I],
          [I,I,A],
          [A,I,A]]

For input0, the output matrix has 'I' in the positions where the input has 'E', 'B', and 'A'.

input1: [[C,A,A,C,C,A,F],
        [A,C,C,A,A,A,C],
        [A,B,A,A,A,A,A],
        [A,A,A,A,C,A,J],
        [A,J,A,A,A,A,C],
        [A,A,C,B,A,A,I],
        [C,A,A,C,C,A,A]]

output1: [[A,A,A],
          [I,I,I],
          [A,A,A]]

For input1, the output matrix has 'I' in the positions where the input has 'A'.

input2: [[A,E,A,A,E,B,D],
        [D,D,E,D,A,D,H],
        [D,A,A,A,B,A,D],
        [A,A,D,A,D,A,A],
        [D,A,A,D,D,A,D],
        [D,A,D,A,D,A,D],
        [D,D,D,A,E,C,D]]

output2: [[A,I,I],
          [A,I,A],
          [A,I,A]]

For input2, the output matrix has 'I' in the positions where the input has 'A' and 'E'.

input3: [[B,A,B,A,H,A,A],
        [B,B,J,B,A,B,A],
        [A,A,B,B,A,C,A],
        [A,A,A,A,D,A,B],
        [A,E,A,B,A,A,B],
        [A,A,B,A,C,A,I],
        [A,A,B,A,H,D,B]]

output3: [[A,A,I],
          [I,I,A],
          [A,I,A]]

For input3, the output matrix has 'I' in the positions where the input has 'A', 'B', and 'E'.

input4: [[A,D,A,D,F,D,A],
        [A,A,D,D,A,A,A],
        [I,A,A,A,A,A,D],
        [D,E,D,J,D,A,D],
        [A,A,J,D,B,D,D],
        [A,D,D,D,A,D,A],
        [A,A,A,A,A,A,D]]

output4: [[A,I,I],
          [A,I,A],
          [A,I,A]]

For input4, the output matrix has 'I' in the positions where the input has 'A', 'D', and 'E'.

input5: [[A,A,A,C,C,A,C],
        [A,C,C,J,C,C,A],
        [A,F,A,C,E,G,A],
        [C,A,A,A,A,J,C],
        [A,A,A,C,C,A,A],
        [I,A,C,J,A,G,D],
        [A,C,A,C,A,C,E]]

output5: [[A,A,A],
          [I,I,I],
          [A,A,A]]

For input5, the output matrix has 'I' in the positions where the input has 'A' and 'C'.

input6: [[A,A,C,A,B,F,D],
        [A,A,C,J,A,C,A],
        [C,C,C,E,C,A,A],
        [A,C,A,C,H,C,A],
        [C,C,A,A,C,C,G],
        [A,C,C,A,C,A,A],
        [F,A,E,C,A,C,C]]

output6: [[A,A,A],
          [I,I,I],
          [A,A,A]]

For input6, the output matrix has 'I' in the positions where the input has 'A' and 'C'.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. Create a 3x3 matrix with 'A' in the center of each row and column.
2. Replace 'A' with 'I' in the positions where the input matrix has 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'E'.

Applying this rule to input8:

input8: [[A,A,I,B,B,A,B],
        [F,B,B,A,B,B,A],
        [A,B,A,B,A,A,B],
        [B,A,C,A,A,G,A],
        [G,A,B,B,F,A,A],
        [A,A,D,A,A,A,F],
        [A,B,A,A,C,A,B]]

output8: [[A,A,A],
          [I,I,I],
          [A,A,A]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is [[A,A,A],
                                                [I,I,I],
                                                [A,A,A]].

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. The output is always a 3x3 matrix.
2. The center element of the output matrix is always 'I' (Intelligent).
3. The other elements of the output matrix are 'A' (Adventurer) or 'I' (Intelligent), depending on the input matrix.

Now, let's examine the input matrices more closely:

1. In the input matrices, the 'I' (Intelligent) elements are always in a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.
2. The length of this diagonal line is always an odd number.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:

- If the length of the diagonal line of 'I' elements in the input matrix is 1, the output matrix will have two 'I' elements in the corners.
- If the length of the diagonal line of 'I' elements in the input matrix is 3, the output matrix will have one 'I' element in the center.

For input7:

[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,F,A,A,A,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,F,F,F,F,A,A]]

The diagonal line of 'I' elements has a length of 3. Therefore, according to the transformation rule, the corresponding output matrix will have one 'I' element in the center:

output7: 3x3
[[I,A,A],
[A,A,A],
[A,A,A]]
expected: [[I,A,A],
[A,A,A],
[A,A,A]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

For input0:
- G in the input becomes C in the output.
- H in the input remains H in the output.
- Empty cells (no G or H) in the input remain empty in the output.

For input1:
- G in the input becomes C in the output.
- H in the input becomes H in the output.
- Empty cells in the input remain empty in the output.

For input2:
- G in the input becomes C in the output.
- H in the input becomes H in the output.
- Empty cells in the input remain empty in the output.

The pattern is consistent across all the given examples:
- Replace all G's with C's.
- Keep all H's as they are.
- Empty cells remain unchanged.

Applying this rule to input4:
input4: 4x4
[[G,H,H,G],
[G,H,G,H],
[H,H,H,G],
[H,G,H,G]]

output4: 4x4
[[C,H,H,C],
[C,H,C,H],
[H,H,H,C],
[H,C,H,C]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[C,H,H,C],
[C,H,C,H],
[H,H,H,C],
[H,C,H,C]]
expected: [[C,H,H,C],
[C,H,C,H],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input-output pairs:
input0 -> output0
input1 -> output1
input2 -> output2

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to be cyclic, moving elements in a specific pattern.
2. In each row, the elements cycle through the unique elements of that row.

Let's look at the first row of each input-output pair:
- input0: C, B, E
- output0: C, B, E
- No change in the first row

Now, let's look at the second row:
- input0: F, F, F
- output0: F, F, F
- No change in the second row

For the remaining rows, we can see a pattern:
- In input0, rows 3-8 have A, and in output0, they cycle as C, B, E, C, B, E.
- In input1, rows 3-9 have A, and in output1, they cycle as D, C, B, E, D, C, B, E.
- In input2, rows 2-5 have A, and in output2, they cycle as I, D, I, D.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for input4:

For each row in input4, the elements cycle through the unique elements of that row in the order: B, C, D, E, I.

Applying this rule to input4:

output4:
[[B,C,D,E,I],
[F,F,F,F,F],
[B,B,B,B,B],
[C,C,C,C,C],
[D,D,D,D,D],
[E,E,E,E,E],
[I,I,I,I,I],
[B,B,B,B,B],
[C,C,C,C,C],
[D,D,D,D,D],
[E,E,E,E,E],
[I,I,I,I,I]]

The transformation rule for input4 is:
Each row cycles through its unique elements in the order: B, C, D, E, I.
expected: [[B,C,D,E,I],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs.

For input0:
- The input is a 17x16 grid.
- The output is a 3x3 grid.
- The output contains only three elements: B (black), F (white), and C (corners).

For input1:
- The input is an 17x18 grid.
- The output is a 3x3 grid.
- The output contains only three elements: E (empty), F (white), and C (corners).

Now, let's analyze the input3:
- The input is a 13x14 grid.
- The output should be a 3x3 grid based on the previous examples.

To determine the output for input3, we need to identify the key elements in the input grid that correspond to the output grid.

1. The corners in the input grid are represented by C. In the output grid, the corners are represented by B. So, we can assume that in the output for input3, the corners will be B.

2. The empty spaces in the input grid are represented by G. In the output grid, the empty spaces are represented by E. So, we can assume that in the output for input3, the empty spaces will be E.

3. The white spaces in the input grid are represented by F. In the output grid, the white spaces are represented by F. So, we can assume that in the output for input3, the white spaces will be F.

Based on these observations, the output for input3 should be:

output3: 3x3
[[C,C,C],
[C,F,C],
[C,C,C]]

The corners are represented by B in the previous examples, but since there are no corners in the input3, we replace them with C (which is not used in input3) to maintain consistency with the pattern observed in the given examples.
expected: [[C,C,C],
[C,F,C],
[C,C,C]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

For input0:
- The 'E' character appears in the center of the output.
- The 'A' characters in the input form a diamond shape, and they are all present in the output.
- The 'B' and 'E' characters form a cross shape in the input, and the 'B' characters are absent in the output.

For input1:
- The 'G' character appears in the center of the output.
- The 'A' characters form a diamond shape, and they are all present in the output.
- The 'B' characters form a cross shape in the input, and the 'B' characters are absent in the output.

For input2:
- The 'D' character appears in the center of the output.
- The 'A' characters form a diamond shape, and they are all present in the output.
- The 'B' characters form a cross shape in the input, and the 'B' characters are absent in the output.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
1. The character that appears in the center of the output is the one that appears most frequently in the input, forming a cross shape.
2. The 'A' characters form a diamond shape in the input, and all of them are present in the output.
3. The characters other than the one in the center and 'A' are absent in the output.

Applying this rule to input4:
1. The character that appears most frequently in the input, forming a cross shape, is 'C'.
2. The 'A' characters form a diamond shape in the input, and all of them are present in the output.
3. The characters other than 'C' and 'A' are absent in the output.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
3x3
[[C,C,C],
[C,A,A],
[A,A,A]]
expected: [[C,C,C],
[C,A,A],
[A,A,A]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0:
[[D,D,D,D,D,D],
 [J,J,J,J,J,J]]

Output0:
[[D,J,D,J,D,J],
 [J,D,J,D,J,D]]

Input1:
[[E,E,E,E,E,E],
 [I,I,I,I,I,I]]

Output1:
[[E,I,E,I,E,I],
 [I,E,I,E,I,E]]

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to involve swapping adjacent elements in each row, but not in a straightforward manner.
2. In the first row of the output, the first and last elements are the same as in the input, while the middle elements alternate between the two input elements.
3. In the second row of the output, the first and last elements are swapped compared to the input, and the middle elements alternate between the two input elements.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:

1. For the first row:
   - The first element in the output is the same as the first element in the input.
   - The last element in the output is the same as the last element in the input.
   - The middle elements (2nd to 5th) alternate between the two input elements.

2. For the second row:
   - The first element in the output is the same as the last element in the input.
   - The last element in the output is the same as the first element in the input.
   - The middle elements (2nd to 5th) alternate between the two input elements.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input3:

Input3:
[[G,G,G,G,G,G],
 [C,C,C,C,C,C]]

Output3:
[[G,C,G,C,G,C],
 [C,G,C,G,C,G]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input3 is:
[[G,C,G,C,G,C],
 [C,G,C,G,C,G]]
expected: [[G,C,G,C,G,C],
[C,G,C,G,C,G]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The transformation replaces each'red' cell with a 'green' cell, and each 'black' cell remains unchanged.
2. The number of columns in the output is always 3, but the number of rows in the output is always 3 more than the number of rows in the input.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the output for the given input4:

input4: 6x3
[[red,red,red],
[black,red,black],
[black,red,black],
[red,red,red],
[black,red,black],
[black,red,black]]

output4: 9x3
[[green,green,green],
[black,green,black],
[black,green,black],
[green,green,green],
[black,green,black],
[black,green,black],
[green,green,green],
[black,green,black],
[black,green,black]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[green,green,green],
[black,green,black],
[black,green,black],
[green,green,green],
[black,green,black],
[black,green,black],
[green,green,green],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

For each row in the input, the corresponding row in the output follows this pattern:
- The first and last cells are always red.
- The middle cells (excluding the first and last) alternate between black and red, starting with black.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Input0: 7x7
   Output0: 7x7
   - The first and last cells are red.
   - The middle cells alternate between black and red, starting with black.

2. Input1: 5x5
   Output1: 5x5
   - The first and last cells are red.
   - The middle cells alternate between black and red, starting with black.

3. Input2: 9x9
   Output2: 9x9
   - The first and last cells are red.
   - The middle cells alternate between black and red, starting with black.

Based on these examples, we can deduce the output for input4 (11x11):

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. input0: 10x10
   output0: 2x2
   The output is a 2x2 square filled with the color purple if there are at least 5 purple cells in the input.

2. input1: 10x10
   output1: 2x2
   The output is a 2x2 square filled with the color pink if there are at least 5 pink cells in the input.

3. input2: 10x10
   output2: 2x2
   The output is a 2x2 square filled with the color yellow if there are at least 5 yellow cells in the input.

Based on these examples, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

If there are at least 5 cells of the same color in the input, the corresponding output will be a 2x2 square filled with that color.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input4:

input4: 10x10
[[blue,blue,blue,blue,blue,black,white,white,white,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],

[blue,blue,blue,blue,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[black,black,black,black,black,black,white,white,white,white]]

There are at least 5 blue cells in the input, so the corresponding output will be a 2x2 square filled with the color blue.

output4: 2x2

For each color in the input, we can observe the following:

1. Blue:
   - In the output, blue always appears in the first and last columns.
   - The number of blue cells in each row is doubled compared to the input.

2. Black:
   - In the output, black appears in every other column, starting from the second column.
   - The number of black cells in each row is the same as in the input.

3. Green:
   - In the output, green appears in every other column, starting from the third column.
   - The number of green cells in each row is the same as in the input.

4. Red:
   - In the output, red appears in the columns between the blue and black/green columns.
   - The number of red cells in each row is doubled compared to the input.

Applying these observations to the given input4:

output: To determine the output for the given input5, let's analyze the pattern in the provided input-output pairs.

For each input, the output follows these rules:
1. The outermost row and column are filled with the color that appears in the second row and second column of the input, respectively.
2. The second row and second column are filled with a different color (in this case, black).
3. The remaining inner cells are filled with the color from the outermost row and column.

Applying these rules to input5:

Output:
1. The outermost row (row 0) will be filled with the color from the second row (row 1) of the input.
2. The outermost column (column 0) will be filled with the color from the second column (column 1) of the input.
3. The second row and second column will be filled with black.
4. The remaining inner cells will be filled with the color from the outermost row and column.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For input0:
- The outermost layer (first and last rows/columns) remains unchanged.
- The second and third rows/columns are mirrored about the central row/column.

For input1:
- The outermost layer (first and last rows/columns) remains unchanged.
- The second and third rows/columns are mirrored about the central row/column.

For input2:
- The outermost layer (first and last rows/columns) remains unchanged.
- The second and third rows/columns are mirrored about the central row/column.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
1. The outermost layer (first and last rows/columns) remains unchanged.
2. The second and third rows/columns are mirrored about the central row/column.

Applying this rule to input4:

input4: 8x3

[yellow,orange,yellow],
[brown,brown,yellow],
[green,brown,green],
[orange,yellow,orange],
[yellow,orange,yellow],

output4: 4x3
[[orange,yellow,orange],
[yellow,orange,yellow],
[brown,brown,yellow],
[green,brown,green]]

The outermost layer (first and last rows) remains unchanged, and the second and third rows are mirrored about the central row.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. The input is expanded horizontally by a factor of 2 in the output.
2. Each row in the input is duplicated in the output, with the duplicated row shifted to the right by one position.
3. The color order within each row is preserved, but the colors are repeated in the output.

Applying these rules to the given input4:

input4: 5x4
[[yellow,black,black,black],
[yellow,orange,black,black],
[black,orange,brown,black],
[brown,brown,red,black],
[black,black,black,red]]

Step 1: Expand horizontally by a factor of 2
5x4 → 5x8

Step 2: Duplicate each row and shift the duplicated row to the right by one position
Row 1: [[yellow,black,black,black,yellow,black,black,black],
       [yellow,black,black,black,yellow,black,black,black]]

Row 2: [[yellow,orange,black,black,yellow,orange,black,black],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Observations:
1. The output size is always 5x5, regardless of the input size.
2. The output is always a reflection of the input along the central vertical axis.
3. The colors are transformed as follows:
   - black remains black
   - purple remains purple if it is in the top or bottom row of the input
   - purple becomes black if it is in the middle row of the input

Applying these observations to the last input example:

input6: 6x6
[[black,black,purple,purple,black,black],
[purple,purple,purple,purple,black,black],
[purple,purple,black,purple,purple,black],
[black,purple,purple,purple,purple,black],
[black,purple,purple,black,black,black],
[black,black,black,black,black,black]]

Output:
The output will be a 5x5 matrix with the following transformation:
- The top row will have purple cells in the positions corresponding to the purple cells in the 2nd and 3rd rows of the input.
- The bottom row will have purple cells in the positions corresponding to the purple cells in the 4th and 5th rows of the input.
- The middle row will have black cells.

SOLUTION found for e9afcf9a at index 801.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each pair:
- The input is a 2x6 grid with two colors.
- The output is a 2x6 grid where the colors are swapped in a specific pattern.

Let's denote the two colors as C1 and C2.

Observations:
1. In the output, the colors are swapped in a zigzag pattern, starting with the first row.
2. The pattern repeats every 4 cells in each row.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:

For each cell in the output:
1. If the cell is in the first or third column, swap the colors (C1 becomes C2 and vice versa).
2. If the cell is in the second or fourth column, keep the color the same.
3. If the cell is in the fifth or sixth column, swap the colors again (C1 becomes C2 and vice versa).

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example:

input3: 2x6
[[brown,brown,brown,brown,brown,brown],
[green,green,green,green,green,green]]

output3: 2x6
[[brown,green,brown,green,brown,green],
[green,brown,green,brown,green,brown]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input3 is:
[[brown,green,brown,green,brown,green],
[green,brown,green,brown,green,brown]]
expected: [[brown,green,brown,green,brown,green],
[green,brown,green,brown,green,brown]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0:
- The first row of the output is the unique elements from the first row of the input, in the order they appear.
- The second row of the output consists of the most frequent element in each column of the input.
- The third row of the output consists of the second most frequent element in each column of the input.

Input1:
- The output has the same number of rows as the input.
- The first column of the output is the unique elements from the first column of the input, in the order they appear.
- The remaining columns of the output consist of the most frequent element in each column of the input.

Input2:
- The output has the same number of rows as the input.
- The first column of the output is the unique elements from the first column of the input, in the order they appear.
- The remaining columns of the output consist of the most frequent element in each column of the input.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule for input4 can be deduced as follows:

Output4:
- The output will have the same number of rows as the input (5 rows).
- The first column of the output will consist of the unique elements from the first column of the input, in the order they appear: [Alfa, Charlie, Alfa, Echo, Echo].
- The remaining columns of the output will consist of the most frequent element in each column of the input.

Applying this rule to input4:

Output4:
[[Alfa, Charlie, Alfa, Echo, Echo],
 [Charlie, Charlie, Alfa, Echo, Echo],
 [Alfa, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Alfa],
 [Bravo, Bravo, Alfa, Charlie, Charlie],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. For each input, the first and last rows and columns of the output are filled with 'Bravo'.
2. The second and second-last rows and columns of the output are filled with 'Alfa' and 'Bravo' in an alternating pattern.

Based on this observation, the transformation rule for the given input-output pairs can be stated as follows:

For an input matrix of size n x n:
1. Fill the first and last rows and columns of the output matrix with 'Bravo'.
2. Fill the second and second-last rows and columns of the output matrix with 'Alfa' and 'Bravo' in an alternating pattern.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input4:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

Observations:
1. The transformation starts from the bottom-right corner of the matrix and moves towards the top-left corner.
2. The characters in the output matrix are replaced as follows:
   - 'Alfa' remains unchanged.
   - 'Charlie' replaces 'Alfa' in the row above the current 'Alfa'.
   - 'Echo' replaces 'Alfa' in the row two positions above the current 'Alfa'.
3. The transformation skips the first row and the first column of the matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for the given input4:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input-output pairs:
input0: 14x16 -> output0: 1x3
input1: 9x7 -> output1: 3x1
input2: 11x9 -> output2: 4x1

Observations:
1. The output dimensions are not consistent. They vary based on the input size and content.
2. The output always contains unique characters from the input, one per row.
3. The output seems to be sorted in alphabetical order.

Let's apply these observations to the last input example (input4) to deduce the corresponding output.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. The 'Charlie' row always remains the same.
2. The 'Bravo' row is created by moving one position to the right in the 'Charlie' row, and replacing the leftmost 'Charlie' with 'Bravo'.
3. The 'Delta' pattern is formed by moving two positions to the right in the 'Charlie' row, and replacing the leftmost 'Charlie' with 'Delta'.

Applying this rule to the given input4:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output size is always 3x3, regardless of the input size.
2. In the output, the 'India' character always appears in the top-left corner.
3. The remaining two rows and columns of the output are filled with the 'Alfa' character.
4. The 'Foxtrot' character in the input does not appear in the output.
5. The 'India' character in the output corresponds to the last occurrence of 'India' in the input, either in a row or a column.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for input7:

1. Identify the row or column containing the last 'India' in the input.
2. Extract the 3x3 submatrix centered around the last 'India'.
3. If the last 'India' is not in the center of the input, adjust the submatrix to ensure the 'India' is in the top-left corner of the output.

Applying this rule to input7:

1. The last 'India' appears in the 4th, 5th, and 6th rows, and also in the 4th, 5th, and 6th columns.
2. Extract the 3x3 submatrix centered around the last 'India':
   [[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
    [Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
    [Alfa,Alfa,Alfa]]
3. Since the 'India' is already in the center, no adjustment is needed.

Therefore, the output for input7 is:

[[India,Alfa,Alfa],
 [Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
 [Alfa,Alfa,Alfa]]
expected: [[India,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each cell in the input, if the value is 'Golf', the corresponding cell in the output will be replaced with 'Charlie'. If the value is 'Hotel', the corresponding cell in the output will remain 'Hotel'.

Applying this rule to the given input4:

input4: 4x4
[[Golf,Hotel,Hotel,Golf],
[Golf,Hotel,Golf,Hotel],
[Hotel,Hotel,Hotel,Golf],
[Hotel,Golf,Hotel,Golf]]

output4: 4x4
[[Charlie,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],
[Charlie,Hotel,Charlie,Hotel],
[Hotel,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],
[Hotel,Charlie,Hotel,Charlie]]

So, the corresponding output for input4 is:

output4: 4x4
[[Charlie,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],
[Charlie,Hotel,Charlie,Hotel],
[Hotel,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],
[Hotel,Charlie,Hotel,Charlie]]
expected: [[Charlie,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],

output: Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the transformation rule is as follows:

For each input board, the output board contains only the letter that appears most frequently in the last column of the input board.

Let's verify this rule for the given input examples:

input0: The most frequent letter in the last column is "Alfa". So, the output is [[Alfa]].
input1: The most frequent letter in the last column is "Hotel". So, the output is [[Hotel]].
input2: The most frequent letter in the last column is "Charlie". So, the output is [[Charlie]].

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example (input4):

input4: The most frequent letter in the last column is "Alfa". So, the corresponding output for input4 should be [[Alfa]].

Therefore, the output for input4 is:
output4: 1x1
[[Alfa]]
expected: [[Hotel]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to be moving the "Delta" element one position to the right in each row.
2. The "Echo" element remains in the last position of its row.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule for the given input-output pairs can be stated as follows:

For each row in the input matrix:
1. If the current element is "Delta", replace it with "Alfa".
2. If the current element is "Alfa" and the next element (to the right) is not "Alfa", replace it with "Delta".
3. If the current element is "Alfa" and the next element (to the right) is also "Alfa", leave it as "Alfa".
4. The last element in each row remains "Echo".

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input8:

input8: 11x11

As an experienced mathematician you are presented with a set of 2D input/output board pairs. Find the input-to-output transformation rule:
input0: 2x2
[[8,6],
[6,4]]

output0: 6x6
[[8,6,8,6,8,6],
[6,4,6,4,6,4],
[6,8,6,8,6,8],
[4,6,4,6,4,6],
[8,6,8,6,8,6],
[6,4,6,4,6,4]]

input1: 2x2
[[7,9],
[4,3]]

output1: 6x6
[[7,9,7,9,7,9],
[4,3,4,3,4,3],
[9,7,9,7,9,7],
[3,4,3,4,3,4],
[7,9,7,9,7,9],
[4,3,4,3,4,3]]

Now you consider the last input example. You must deduce the corresponding output for it.

SOLUTION found for 00576224 at index 899.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

Given:
- input0: 2x2 [[8,6], [6,4]]
- output0: 6x6 [[8,6,8,6,8,6], [6,4,6,4,6,4], [6,8,6,8,6,8], [4,6,4,6,4,6], [8,6,8,6,8,6], [6,4,6,4,6,4]]
- input1: 2x2 [[7,9], [4,3]]
- output1: 6x6 [[7,9,7,9,7,9], [4,3,4,3,4,3], [9,7,9,7,9,7], [3,4,3,4,3,4], [7,9,7,9,7,9], [4,3,4,3,4,3]]

Observations:
1. The output matrix is always a square matrix with a size that is three times the size of the input matrix.
2. The output matrix is created by repeating the rows of the input matrix three times in a cyclic manner.
3. The order of the rows in the output matrix is maintained as in the input matrix.

Now, let's apply the transformation to the given input3:

input3: 2x2 [[3,2], [7,8]]

Output:
- The output matrix size will be 3 × 2 = 6x6.
- The output matrix will be created by repeating the rows of the input matrix three times in a cyclic manner.
- The order of the rows in the output matrix will be maintained as in the input matrix.

Therefore, the output for input3 is:

output3: 6x6 [[3,2,3,2,3,2], [7,8,7,8,7,8], [2,3,2,3,2,3], [8,7,8,7,8,7], [3,2,3,2,3,2], [7,8,7,8,7,8]]
expected: [[3,2,3,2,3,2],
[7,8,7,8,7,8],
[2,3,2,3,2,3],
[8,7,8,7,8,7],
[3,2,3,2,3,2],
[7,8,7,8,7,8]]

SOLUTION found for 009d5c81 at index 1460.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to be replacing 8 with 7, 0 with 0, and 1 with 1.
2. However, in the second input-output pair, 8 is replaced with 3 instead of 7.
3. In the third input-output pair, 8 is replaced with 7, 0 with 0, and 1 with 0.
4. In the fourth input-output pair, 8 is replaced with 3, 0 with 0, and 1 with 0.

Based on these observations, it appears that the transformation rule depends on the surrounding cells of the 8, 0, and 1 values.

Transformation rule:
1. If a cell contains an 8 and its top-left cell contains a 1, replace the 8 with 7.
2. If a cell contains an 8 and its top-left cell contains an 8, replace the 8 with 3.
3. If a cell contains an 8 and its top-left cell contains a 0, replace the 8 with 7.
4. If a cell contains a 1 and its top-left cell contains a 1, replace the 1 with 0.
5. If a cell contains a 1 and its top-left cell contains an 8, replace the 1 with 0.
6. If a cell contains a 1 and its top-left cell contains a 0, replace the 1 with 0.
7. If a cell contains any other value (0), keep it unchanged.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the given input6:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a 1x1 matrix containing a single value.
2. The value in the output matrix is always the value at the center of the input matrix.

For input0:
- The input is a 5x5 matrix
- The center value is 8
- The output is [[0]], which corresponds to the value at the center (8) being 0.

For input1:
- The input is a 5x7 matrix
- The center value is 0
- The output is [[8]], which corresponds to the value at the center (0) being 8.

For input2:
- The input is a 6x7 matrix
- The center value is 8
- The output is [[8]], which corresponds to the value at the center (8) being 8.

For input3:
- The input is a 6x7 matrix
- The center value is 0
- The output is [[0]], which corresponds to the value at the center (0) being 0.

For input4:
- The input is a 6x7 matrix
- The center value is 8
- The output is [[8]], which corresponds to the center value (8) being 8.

For input5:
- The input is a 6x6 matrix
- The center value is 0
- The output is [[0]], which corresponds to the center value (0) being 0.

Based on these observations, the input-to-output transformation rule is:
- If the value at the center of the input matrix is 0, the output will be [[0]].
- If the value at the center of the input matrix is not 0, the output will be [[value_at_center]].

Applying this rule to input7:
- The input is an 8x6 matrix
- The center value is 0 (at position [3,3])
- According to the rule, the output should be [[0]].

Therefore, the corresponding output for input7 is [[0]].

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input0: [[5,5,0],
        [5,0,5],
        [0,5,0]]

Output0: [[1]]

Input1: [[8,0,8],
        [0,8,0],
        [8,0,8]]

Output1: [[2]]

Input2: [[5,0,5],
        [0,5,0],
        [5,0,5]]

Output2: [[2]]

Input3: [[0,1,1],
        [0,1,1],
        [1,0,0]]

Output3: [[3]]

Input4: [[0,8,8],
        [0,8,8],
        [8,0,0]]

Output4: [[3]]

Input5: [[4,4,0],
        [4,0,4],
        [0,4,0]]

Output5: [[1]]

Input6: [[0,5,0],
        [5,5,5],
        [0,5,0]]

Output6: [[6]]

From the given examples, we can observe the following:

1. The output is always a 1x1 matrix.
2. The output value seems to be related to the number of non-zero elements in the input matrix.

Let's count the non-zero elements in each input matrix:

Input0: 8 non-zero elements
Input1: 5 non-zero elements
Input2: 5 non-zero elements
Input3: 6 non-zero elements
Input4: 5 non-zero elements
Input5: 6 non-zero elements
Input6: 9 non-zero elements

Now, let's look at the corresponding output values:

Output0: 1
Output1: 2
Output2: 2
Output3: 3
Output4: 3
Output5: 1
Output6: 6

We can see that the output value is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the input matrix, except for Input6. In Input6, there are 9 non-zero elements, but the output is 6.

To handle this exception, we can add a constant value to the output when the number of non-zero elements is equal to the size of the input matrix (which is 3x3). In this case, we can add 3 to the count of non-zero elements.

So, the final transformation rule is:

Output = Number of non-zero elements in the input matrix + (Size of input matrix - 1)

For input8: [[0,8,0],
             [8,8,8],
             [0,8,0]]

There are 7 non-zero elements, and the size of the input matrix is 3x3.

Output8 = 7 + (3 - 1) = 8

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is:

[[8]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. For input0:
   - The input is 3x9, and the output is 3x3.
   - The transformation seems to be removing every second row and every second column from the input.

2. For input1:
   - The input is 4x12, and the output is 4x4.
   - The transformation is similar to input0, removing every second row and every second column.

3. For input2:
   - The input is 2x6, and the output is 2x2.
   - The transformation is also removing every second row and every second column.

Now, let's apply the same transformation to input4:

Input4: 5x15
[[0,2,0,4,4,0,2,0,4,4,0,2,0,4,4],
[2,2,0,4,4,2,2,0,4,4,2,2,0,4,4],

[1,1,0,2,0,1,1,0,2,0,1,1,0,2,0]]

After removing every second row and every second column, we get:

Output4: 5x5
[[0,2,0,4,4],
[2,2,0,4,4],
[0,2,2,2,0],
[1,1,0,2,2],

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is a 5x5 matrix.

output: Based on the given input-output pairs, it seems that the transformation rule is to replace each cell value with the average of its 3x3 neighborhood, rounded down to the nearest integer.

For input4, the corresponding output would be:

output4: 3x3
[[5,5,5],
[5,5,5],
[5,5,5]]

The reasoning is as follows:

1. In the first input-output pair, the output is all 4s, which is the average of the 3x3 neighborhood around each cell in the input.

2. In the second input-output pair, the output is all 3s, which is the average of the 3x3 neighborhood around each cell in the input.

3. In the third input-output pair, the output is all 8s, which is the average of the 3x3 neighborhood around each cell in the input.

4. Applying the same rule to input4, the average of the 3x3 neighborhood around each cell is calculated and rounded down to the nearest integer, resulting in the output4 shown above.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. The outermost ring of 1s is always present in the output, regardless of the input size.

2. Inside the outermost ring, there are two types of patterns:
   a. A cross-like pattern in the center (for odd-sized inputs)
   b. A hollow square pattern in the center (for even-sized inputs)

3. The cross-like pattern consists of 1s placed at the intersections of the center row and center column, excluding the center cell itself.

4. The hollow square pattern consists of 1s placed along the edges of the central square, excluding the center cell and the cells along the outermost ring.

Now, let's apply these rules to the given input4:

Since the input size is 11x11 (odd-sized), we should have a cross-like pattern in the center.

Here's the corresponding output for input4:

output: Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the transformation rule is as follows:

1. The output size is always 5x5, regardless of the input size.
2. The output matrix is constructed by selecting every 4th row from the input matrix (starting from the second row) and every 2nd column from the input matrix (starting from the first column).
3. The selected elements are placed in the output matrix in a zigzag pattern, starting from the top-left corner.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0:
[[9,8,8,8,9],
 [8,8,2,8,8],
 [8,2,2,2,8],
 [8,8,2,8,8],
 [9,8,8,8,9]]

Output0:
[[9,8,8,8,9,9,2,8,9,2],
 [8,8,2,8,8,9,2,8,9,2],
 [8,2,2,2,8,9,2,8,9,2],

 [2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,9,2],
 [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,9,9,2],
 [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2],
 [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8]]

Observations:
1. The outermost ring of the output is filled with the outermost ring of the input, but mirrored.
2. The inner square of the output is filled with the inner square of the input, but with an additional layer of the outermost value (9 in this case) added around it.

Input1:
[[2,3,3,3,2],
 [3,3,5,3,3],
 [3,5,5,5,3],
 [3,3,5,3,3],
 [2,3,3,3,2]]

Output1:
[[2,3,3,3,2,2,5,3,2,5],
 [3,3,5,3,3,2,5,3,2,5],
 [3,5,5,5,3,2,5,3,2,5],

 [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,2,2,5],
 [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,5,5],
 [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3]]

Observations:
1. The outermost ring of the output is filled with the outermost ring of the input, but mirrored.
2. The inner square of the output is filled with the inner square of the input, but with an additional layer of the outermost value (5 in this case) added around it.

Now, let's apply these observations to the last input example:

Input3:
[[5,1,1,1,5],
 [1,1,9,1,1],
 [1,9,9,9,1],
 [1,1,9,1,1],
 [5,1,1,1,5]]

Applying the transformation rule:
1. The outermost ring of the output will be filled with the outermost ring of the input, but mirrored:
   [[5,1,1,1,5],
    [1,1,9,1,1],
    [1,9,9,9,1],
    [1,1,9,1,1],
    [5,1,1,1,5]]

2. The inner square of the output will be filled with the inner square of the input, but with an additional layer of the outermost value (5 in this case) added around it:
   [[5,1,1,1,5,5,9,1,5,9],
    [1,1,9,1,1,5,9,1,5,9],
    [1,9,9,9,1,5,9,1,5,9],
    [1,1,9,1,1,5,9,1,5,9],
    [5,1,1,1,5,5,9,1,5,9],
    [5,5,5,5,5,9,9,1,5,9],
    [9,9,9,9,9,9,1,1,5,9],
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,9],
    [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9],
    [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1]]

Therefore, the output for input3 is:
[[5,1,1,1,5,5,9,1,5,9],
 [1,1,9,1,1,5,9,1,5,9],
 [1,9,9,9,1,5,9,1,5,9],

 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,5,5,9],
 [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,9,9],
 [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,1]]
expected: [[5,1,1,1,5,5,9,1,5,9],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input0: 7x7
Output0: 3x3
[[1,0,0],
[0,1,0],
[0,0,0]]

Input1: 7x5
Output1: 3x3

[0,1,0],
[0,0,0]]

Input4: 5x5
Output4: 3x3
[[1,0,0],
[0,0,0],
[0,0,0]]

Observations:
1. The output size is always 3x3.
2. The output matrix has 1s along the main diagonal, indicating that the output is a diagonal matrix.
3. The number of 1s in the output matrix corresponds to the number of non-zero rows in the input matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the output for input6:

Input6: 8x5
[[0,0,0,0,0],
[0,3,3,0,0],
[0,3,3,0,0],
[2,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,3],
[3,3,0,0,0],
[3,3,0,2,2],
[0,0,0,2,2]]

The input matrix has 6 non-zero rows. Therefore, the output matrix should be a 3x3 diagonal matrix with 6 1s along the main diagonal.

Output6: 3x3
[[1,0,0],
[0,1,0],
[0,0,1]]

The output matrix has 6 1s along the main diagonal, corresponding to the 6 non-zero rows in the input matrix.
expected: [[1,0,0],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input0: [[2,0,2],
        [0,2,0],
        [2,0,2]]

Output0: [[1]]

Output4: [[7]]

Input5: [[2,2,0],
        [0,2,0],
        [0,0,0]]

Output5: [[7]]

Now, let's consider the last input example:

Input7: [[2,0,2],
        [2,2,2],
        [2,0,2]]

To determine the output for this input, we can look for similarities between this input and the previous inputs.

Input7 has two "hot spots" where the value 2 is concentrated:
1. The center cell (1,1) has a value of 2.
2. The top-right and bottom-right cells (2,2) and (2,3) have values of 2.

In the previous inputs, the outputs were 1 when the "hot spots" were symmetric around the center cell (like in input2) and 7 when the "hot spots" were not symmetric (like in inputs 1, 4, and 5).

In input7, the "hot spots" are symmetric around the center cell (1,1). Therefore, the output for input7 should be 1.

Output7: [[1]]

So, the corresponding output for input7 is [[1]].
expected: [[1]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input, we can observe the following:
1. The outermost layer of 8's expands inwards by one cell in each row/column until it reaches the innermost layer of 1's or 3's.
2. The innermost layer of 1's or 3's expands outwards by one cell in each row/column until it reaches the outermost layer of 8's.
3. The pattern repeats in each row and column, maintaining the relative positions of the numbers.

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example:

input4: 4x14
[[3,8,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[2,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[1,3,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[2,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Output:
[[3,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,3],
[2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2],
[1,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,1],
[2,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,2]]

The outermost layer of 3's and 8's expands inwards by one cell in each row/column until it reaches the innermost layer of 1's. The innermost layer of 1's expands outwards by one cell in each row/column until it reaches the outermost layer of 3's and 8's. The pattern repeats in each row and column, maintaining the relative positions of the numbers.

output: To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input, we can observe the following:

1. The outermost layer of the output is a copy of the outermost row and column of the input, repeated horizontally and vertically.

2. The second layer from the outside in the output is a copy of the second row and second column of the input, repeated horizontally and vertically.

3. The innermost layer of the output is a copy of the innermost row and column of the input, repeated horizontally and vertically.

4. The diagonal elements in the output are filled with the corresponding elements from the input.

5. The off-diagonal elements in the output are filled with the corresponding elements from the input, but with a twist. If the element in the input is odd, it is repeated twice in the output. If the element in the input is even, it is repeated once in the output.

Applying these rules to the given input4:

input4: 3x3
[[1,1,0],
[0,3,2],
[3,3,0]]

1. Outermost layer: [1,1,0,0,1,1]
2. Second layer from outside: [0,3,2,2,3,0]
3. Innermost layer: [3,3,0,0,3,3]

4. Diagonal elements: [1,0,3,3,1]

5. Off-diagonal elements: [1,1,0,0,1,1], [0,3,2,2,3,0], [3,3,0,0,3,3]

Combining all the layers, the corresponding output for input4 is:

output4: 6x6
[[1,1,0,0,1,1],
[0,3,2,2,3,0],
[3,3,0,0,3,3],

output: Based on the provided input/output pairs, it appears that the transformation rule is:

If the number of 9's in the input is even, the output is 1x1 with [[2]].
If the number of 9's in the input is odd, the output is 1x1 with [[3]].

For the given input4, there are 54 occurrences of 9's, which is an even number. Therefore, the corresponding output should be 1x1 with [[2]].

Output1:
[[5,0,0,6],
 [0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0],

Observations:
1. The non-zero elements in the input matrix are moved to the top-left corner of the output matrix.
2. The non-zero elements in the input matrix maintain their relative positions within the top-left corner of the output matrix.
3. The non-zero elements in the input matrix are surrounded by zeros in the output matrix.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be described as follows:

1. Create a new output matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix.
2. Identify the non-zero elements in the input matrix.
3. Place the non-zero elements in the top-left corner of the output matrix, maintaining their relative positions.
4. Fill the remaining positions in the output matrix with zeros.

Applying this rule to the last input example:

Input3:

 [0,0,0,0]]

Output3:

output: To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output matrix is always a square matrix with a size that is twice the size of the input matrix.
2. The elements in the output matrix are repetitions of the elements in the input matrix, arranged in a specific pattern.
3. The pattern involves filling the output matrix row-wise first, then repeating the same row, and filling the remaining positions column-wise.

Now, let's apply this pattern to the given input5:

input5: 3x3
[[1,6,6],
[5,2,2],
[2,2,2]]

Step 1: Fill the output matrix row-wise.
output5: 6x6
[[1,6,6,6,6,1],
[5,2,2,2,2,5],
[2,2,2,2,2,2],
[2,2,2,2,2,2],
[5,2,2,2,2,5],
[1,6,6,6,6,1]]

Step 2: Fill the remaining positions column-wise.
output5: 6x6

[2,2,2,2,2,2],
[2,2,2,2,2,2],

output2: 3x3
[[1,0,0],
[0,2,0],
[6,0,6]]

Observations:
1. The output matrix is always a square matrix with a size less than or equal to the input matrix.
2. The output matrix seems to be formed by taking every other row from the input matrix, starting from the first row.
3. Within each row of the output matrix, the non-zero elements are the first and last elements of the corresponding row in the input matrix.

Applying these observations to input4:

input4: 6x6
[[3,0,3,0,4,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[7,0,0,0,1,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[7,0,0,0,1,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Step 1: Take every other row, starting from the first row:
[[3,0,3,0,4,0],
 [7,0,0,0,1,0],
 [7,0,0,0,1,0]]

Step 2: Within each row, keep only the first and last elements:
[[3,3,4],
 [7,0,1],
 [7,0,1]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
output4: 3x3
[[3,3,4],
 [7,0,1],
 [7,0,1]]
expected: [[3,3,4],
[7,0,1],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output matrix has three distinct regions: a central region with value 5, and two outer regions with value 0.
2. The central region always contains the maximum value in the input matrix.
3. The output matrix's dimensions are the same as the input matrix's dimensions.
4. The position of the maximum value in the input matrix determines the position of the central region in the output matrix.

Now, let's apply these observations to the last input example:

input6: 3x3
[[4,4,4],
[2,3,2],
[3,2,3]]

Step 1: Find the maximum value in the input matrix.
The maximum value is 4, which appears in the first row and third column.

Step 2: Determine the position of the central region in the output matrix.
Since the maximum value is in the first row and third column, the central region of the output matrix will be in the same positions.

Step 3: Fill the output matrix based on the observations.
The output matrix will have dimensions 3x3, with the central region containing the maximum value (5) and the outer regions containing the value 0.

output6: 3x3
[[0,0,5],
[0,5,0],
[5,0,0]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for the given input6 is:
output6: 3x3
[[0,0,5],
[0,5,0],
[5,0,0]]

SOLUTION found for 6f8cd79b at index 607.
output: To determine the output for the given 7x6 input matrix, we need to analyze the pattern in the provided input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output matrix has the same dimensions as the input matrix.
2. In the output matrix, the value 8 appears in the following positions:
   - Top-left to bottom-right diagonal
   - Second row, except for the middle element
   - Last row, except for the middle element
   - First and last columns, except for the middle two rows
3. The middle element of the output matrix is always 0.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the output for the 7x6 input matrix:

input5: 7x6
[[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0]]

output5: 7x6
[[8,8,8,8,8,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,8,8,8,8,8]]

The output matrix follows the same pattern as the previous examples, with 8 appearing in the specified positions and 0 in the middle element of each row and column.
expected: [[8,8,8,8,8,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],
[8,0,0,0,0,8],

[342] checking 6fa7a44f (solved: 20/800)
Try 1 of 3
SOLUTION found for 6fa7a44f at index 749.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input matrix, we can observe the following:
1. The first and second rows of the output matrix are identical to the first and second rows of the input matrix.
2. The third row of the output matrix is repeated twice.
3. The last two rows of the output matrix are the same as the first two rows, but in reverse order.

Applying these observations to the last input example:

input5: 3x3
[[2,9,2],
[8,5,2],
[2,2,8]]

Step 1: The first and second rows of the output matrix are identical to the first and second rows of the input matrix.
output5: 6x3
[[2,9,2],
[8,5,2],

Step 2: The third row of the output matrix is repeated twice.
output5: 6x3
[[2,9,2],
[8,5,2],
[2,2,8],
[2,2,8],

Step 3: The last two rows of the output matrix are the same as the first two rows, but in reverse order.
output5: 6x3
[[2,9,2],
[8,5,2],
[2,2,8],
[2,2,8],
[8,5,2],
[2,9,2]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for the last input example is:
output5: 6x3
[[2,9,2],
[8,5,2],
[2,2,8],
[2,2,8],
[8,5,2],
[2,9,2]]
expected: [[2,9,2],
[8,5,2],
[2,2,8],
[2,2,8],
[8,5,2],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The first row of the output is always the same as the first row of the input.
2. The second row of the output follows a pattern:
   - If the second row of the input has a value other than 0, the output row at that position will have the same value as the input.
   - If the second row of the input has a value of 0, the output row at that position will have a value of 0.
   - The values in the output row alternate between the non-zero values in the input row, starting from the first non-zero value.
3. The third row of the output is always the same as the first row of the output (which is the same as the first row of the input).

Applying these observations to the given input4:

input4: 3x29
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Applying the transformation rule:
1. The first row of the output will be the same as the first row of the input:
   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

2. The second row of the output will follow the pattern:
   - The output row will have the same values as the input row, with 0s replaced by 0s.
   - The values in the output row will alternate between the non-zero values in the input row, starting from the first non-zero value.
   [2,1,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]

3. The third row of the output will be the same as the first row of the output (which is the same as the first row of the input):
   [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:

    [2,2,0,2,2],
    [0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,2,0,2,2],

    [8,8,0,8,8],
    [8,0,0,8,0]]
   output2:
   [[0,8],
    [8,0]]

Observations:
1. The output is always a 2x2 matrix.
2. The output matrix has two distinct values, which are the maximum and minimum values from the input matrix.
3. The maximum value in the output matrix is always in the top-left corner.
4. The minimum value in the output matrix is always in the bottom-right corner.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for input4:

input4: 5x5
[[5,5,0,5,0],
 [0,5,0,0,5],
 [0,0,0,0,0],
 [5,5,0,5,5],
 [0,5,0,0,5]]

Step 1: Find the maximum and minimum values in the input matrix.
Maximum value: 5
Minimum value: 0

Step 2: Create the output matrix with the maximum and minimum values.
Output matrix:
[[5,0],
 [0,5]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[5,0],
 [0,5]]
expected: [[5,0],

output: Based on the given input-output pairs, the transformation rule seems to be:

1. Identify the largest number in each 7x7 input matrix.
2. Create a 3x3 output matrix where the largest number in the input matrix is placed in the center of the output matrix.
3. Fill the remaining cells in the output matrix with the value 8.

Applying this rule to the last input example:

input8: 7x7
[[0,0,8,1,1,0,1],
[5,1,1,0,1,1,0],
[0,1,0,1,0,0,1],
[1,0,2,0,0,6,0],
[6,0,1,1,5,0,0],
[0,0,3,0,0,0,5],
[0,1,0,0,2,0,1]]

The largest number in the input matrix is 8.

output8: 3x3
[[0,0,8],
[8,8,0],
[0,8,0]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is:
[[0,0,8],
[8,8,0],
[0,8,0]]
expected: [[0,0,8],
[8,8,0],
[0,8,0]]

SOLUTION found for 963e52fc at index 779.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs:

1. The number of rows remains the same in the output as in the input.
2. The number of columns in the output is twice the number of columns in the input.
3. The values in the output are the same as in the input, but they are repeated in the new columns.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule can be summarized as follows:

- If the input has dimensions m x n, the output will have dimensions m x (2n).
- The values in the output will be the same as in the input, and they will be repeated in the new columns.

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example:

input4: 5x9
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[3,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1],
[3,1,1,3,1,1,3,1,1],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

According to the transformation rule, the output will have dimensions 5 x 18 (twice the number of columns in the input).

output4: 5x18
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]

The values in the output are the same as in the input, and they are repeated in the new columns.
expected: [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

output: To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0: 10x8
Output0: 10x8
- The value 2 is replaced by a sequence of 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5.
- The value 6 is replaced by a sequence of 6, 5, 6, 5, 6.

Input1: 10x12
Output1: 10x12
- The value 2 is replaced by a sequence of 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5.
- The value 3 is replaced by a sequence of 3, 5, 3, 5, 3.
- The value 6 is replaced by a sequence of 6, 5, 6, 5, 6.

Input2: 7x8
Output2: 7x8
- The value 8 is replaced by a sequence of 8, 5, 8, 5, 8.

From the patterns, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- If a cell contains a value, replace it with a sequence of that value, separated by 5.
- The sequence starts with the given value and alternates between the given value and 5 until the sequence reaches the edge of the board.

Applying this rule to input4:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. The input matrix is padded with zeros on both sides of each row and column.
2. The number of elements added to each row is equal to the number of elements in the original row.
3. The number of elements added to each column is equal to the number of elements in the original column.
4. The added elements are placed symmetrically around the original elements.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the given input4:

input4: 5x4
[[4,0,0,0],
[4,5,0,0],
[0,5,6,0],
[6,6,1,0],
[0,0,0,1]]

Step 1: Add zeros to both sides of each row.
[[4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0],
[4,5,0,0,4,5,0,0],
[0,5,6,0,0,5,6,0],
[6,6,1,0,6,6,1,0],
[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]]

Step 2: Add zeros to both sides of each column.
[[4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0],
[0,4,0,0,0,4,0,0],
[0,0,4,0,0,0,4,0],
[0,0,0,4,0,0,0,4],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The central square of 2s in the input is replaced by a descending sequence of 2s, 1s, and 0s in the output, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving clockwise.
2. The cells outside the central square remain unchanged in the output, except for the cells directly above and below the central square. These cells are filled with 3s in the output.

Applying these observations to the last input example:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0: 9x3
Output0: 3x3
The output is the central 3x3 submatrix of the input.

Input1: 3x12
Output1: 3x3
The output is the central 3x3 submatrix of the input.

Input2: 3x15
Output2: 3x3
The output is the central 3x3 submatrix of the input.

Input3: 12x3
Output3: 3x3
The output is the central 3x3 submatrix of the input.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to take the central 3x3 submatrix of the input as the output.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input5:

Input5: 15x3
[[0,5,0],
[5,0,5],
[0,5,0],
[0,3,0],
[3,0,3],

[6,0,6],
[0,4,0],
[4,0,4],
[0,4,0],
[0,8,0],
[8,0,8],
[0,8,0]]

The central 3x3 submatrix is:
[[6,0,6],
[6,6,0],
[6,0,6]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input5 is:
Output5: 3x3
[[6,0,6],

output: Based on the given input-output pairs, it appears that the transformation rule is as follows:

1. Identify the central cell in the input matrix that contains the highest value. In this case, it's the cell with value 8.

2. Create a 3x3 output matrix with the highest value (8) in the center of the top row, and 0s in all other cells of the top row.

3. If there are any cells in the input matrix with a value of 5 that are directly above, below, to the left, or to the right of the central cell, place a 0 in the corresponding position in the second row of the output matrix.

4. If there are any cells in the input matrix with a value of 5 that are diagonally adjacent to the central cell, place a 0 in the corresponding position in the third row of the output matrix.

Applying this rule to the given input7:

input7: 9x9
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,5,0,0,0,5,0,0],
[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0],
[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0],
[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0],
[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0],
[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0],
[0,0,5,8,8,8,5,0,0],
[0,0,5,5,5,5,5,0,0]]

The central cell with the highest value (8) is in the 4th row and 3rd column.

Output:
[[8,0,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,0,0]]

The 0s are placed in the output matrix based on the positions of the 5s in the input matrix relative to the central cell with the highest value.
expected: [[8,0,0],
[0,0,0],
[0,0,0]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The transformation seems to be based on the relative positions of the numbers 2 and 7.
2. In the output, the number 2 appears in the positions where the number 6 was in the input.
3. The number 7 remains in the positions where the number 7 was in the input.
4. The number 2 also appears in the positions where the number 7 was in the input, but only if it is surrounded by 7s.

Applying these observations to the last input example:

input4: 4x4
[[6,7,7,6],
[6,7,6,7],
[7,7,7,6],
[7,6,7,6]]

Output:
- The number 6 in the top-left corner of the input becomes 2 in the output.
- The number 7 in the top-right, middle-right, and bottom-left corners of the input remains 7 in the output.
- The number 6 in the middle-left, middle-center, and bottom-right corners of the input becomes 2 in the output.
- The number 7 in the bottom-center position of the input remains 7 in the output.
- The number 2 appears in the top-right and bottom-left positions of the output, as these positions have 7s on both sides in the input.

Output4: 4x4
[[2,7,7,2],
[2,7,2,7],
[7,7,7,2],
[7,2,7,2]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for the last input example is:

output4: 4x4
[[2,7,7,2],
[2,7,2,7],
[7,7,7,2],
[7,2,7,2]]
expected: [[2,7,7,2],

Try 1 of 3
SOLUTION found for b1fc8b8e at index 605.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output matrix is always 5x5, regardless of the input matrix size.
2. The outermost ring of 8's in the input matrix is removed to form the output matrix.
3. If there are 8's in the innermost ring of the input matrix, they are also removed in the output matrix.
4. The relative positions of the 8's within the remaining rings are preserved in the output matrix.

Applying these observations to input6:

Input6:
[[0,0,8,8,0,0],
 [8,8,8,8,0,0],
 [8,8,0,8,8,0],
 [0,8,8,8,8,0],
 [0,8,8,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Removing the outermost ring of 8's and the innermost ring of 8's (if present):

Output6:
[[8,8,0,8,8],
 [8,8,0,8,8],
 [0,0,0,0,0],
 [8,8,0,8,8],
 [8,8,0,8,8]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input6 is:
[[8,8,0,8,8],
 [8,8,0,8,8],
 [0,0,0,0,0],
 [8,8,0,8,8],
 [8,8,0,8,8]]
expected: [[8,8,0,8,8],
[8,8,0,8,8],
[0,0,0,0,0],
[8,8,0,8,8],
[8,8,0,8,8]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0: 17x16
Output0: 3x3
The output is a 3x3 square with value 1 on the edges and value 5 in the center.

Input1: 17x18
Output1: 3x3
The output is a 3x3 square with value 4 on the edges and value 5 in the center.

Now, let's consider the last input example:
Input3: 13x14

Step 1: Determine the output size
From the given input-output pairs, we can see that the output size is always 3x3.

Step 2: Analyze the edge values
In both input-output pairs, the output has values 1 or 4 on the edges and value 5 in the center.

Step 3: Determine the edge values for input3
For input3, we can see that the outermost rows and columns have values 5, while the second and second-to-last rows and columns have values 2.

Step 4: Determine the center value for input3
The center value in the output should be 5, as observed in the given input-output pairs.

Step 5: Construct the output for input3
Based on the edge values and the center value, the output for input3 should be:

Output3: 3x3
[[2,2,2],
 [2,5,2],
 [2,2,2]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input3 is a 3x3 square with value 2 on the edges and value 5 in the center.

output: To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the input and output pairs.

For input0:
- The outermost ring (positions 1-5) remains the same.
- The second ring (positions 6-10) shifts one position to the left.
- The third ring (positions 11-15) shifts two positions to the left.
- The center (position 16) is always 1.

For input1:
- The outermost ring (positions 1-6) remains the same.
- The second ring (positions 7-11) shifts one position to the left.
- The third ring (positions 12-16) shifts two positions to the left.
- The center (position 17) is always 1.

For input2:
- The outermost ring (positions 1-7) remains the same.
- The second ring (positions 8-12) shifts one position to the left.
- The third ring (positions 13-16) shifts two positions to the left.
- The center (position 17) is always 1.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
1. The outermost ring (positions 1-<number of elements in the outermost ring>) remains the same.
2. Each subsequent ring shifts one position to the left compared to the previous ring.
3. The center position (position 16, 17, or 18, depending on the size of the board) is always 1.

Applying this rule to input4:

output: To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each pair, we can observe the following:
1. The outermost ring of 1s remains unchanged.
2. The inner ring of 7s and 8s is replaced with a smaller ring of 5s and 8s, where the 7s are replaced by 5s.

Applying this rule to the last input example:

input4: 3x5
[[1,7,7,1,7],
[8,1,7,7,7],
[8,7,1,7,8]]

Output:
1. The outermost ring of 1s remains unchanged:
   [[1, _, _, 1, _],
    [_, _, _, _, _],
    [_, _, _, _, _]]
2. The inner ring of 7s and 8s is replaced with a smaller ring of 5s and 8s, where the 7s are replaced by 5s:
   [[1,5,5,1,5],
    [8,1,5,5,5],
    [8,5,1,5,8]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:

output4: 3x5
[[1,5,5,1,5],
 [8,1,5,5,5],
 [8,5,1,5,8]]
expected: [[1,5,5,1,5],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input, we can observe the following:

1. The output is always a 3x3 matrix.
2. The top-left element of the output matrix is always the same as the top-left element of the input matrix.
3. The middle element of the first row in the output matrix is the sum of the middle two elements of the first row in the input matrix.
4. The last element of the first row in the output matrix is the same as the last element of the first row in the input matrix.
5. The first element of the second row in the output matrix is the same as the first element of the second row in the input matrix.
6. The middle element of the second row in the output matrix is the sum of the middle two elements of the second row in the input matrix.
7. The last element of the second row in the output matrix is the same as the last element of the second row in the input matrix.
8. The first element of the third row in the output matrix is the same as the first element of the third row in the input matrix.
9. The last element of the third row in the output matrix is the same as the last element of the third row in the input matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the corresponding output for input4:

input4: 5x5
[[7,0,0,0,5],
[0,6,0,4,0],
[0,0,2,0,0],
[0,4,0,6,0],
[5,0,0,0,7]]

output4: 3x3
[[7,6,5],
[4,2,4],
[5,6,7]]

The output matrix is obtained by taking the top-left element from the input matrix, summing the middle two elements of each row, and keeping the last element of each row the same as in the input matrix.
expected: [[7,6,5],
[4,2,4],
[5,6,7]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs.

For input0:
- The 6x6 input matrix has values ranging from 0 to 6.
- The 2x2 output matrix has values 4 and 3.

For input1:
- The 8x8 input matrix has values ranging from 2 to 5.
- The 2x2 output matrix has values 2 and 4.

For input2:
- The 12x6 input matrix has values ranging from 1 to 4.
- The 2x2 output matrix has values 3 and 2.

Based on these observations, it seems that the output matrix is always 2x2, and the values in the output matrix are the two most frequent values in the corresponding input matrix.

Now, let's apply this rule to input4:

Input4:
[[9,6,2,9,9,2,6,9],
 [2,9,9,6,6,9,9,2],
 [6,9,9,2,2,9,9,6],
 [9,2,6,9,9,6,2,9]]

1. Find the two most frequent values in the input matrix:
   - Frequency of 9: 12
   - Frequency of 6: 8
   - Frequency of 2: 6

2. The two most frequent values are 9 and 6.

3. Create the output matrix with these two values:
   [[9,6],
    [2,9]]

Therefore, the output for input4 is:
[[9,6],
 [2,9]]
expected: [[9,6],
[2,9]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output size is always 3x3, regardless of the input size.
2. In the output, the value 5 always represents the presence of the number 1 in the corresponding position of the input, while 0 represents the absence of 1.
3. The output seems to be created by taking the input, applying some transformation, and then placing the transformed values in the output array.

Let's look at the transformation applied in each case:

input0: [[2,0,0,0,0],
         [0,2,0,0,2],
         [2,0,0,2,0],
         [0,0,0,2,2],
         [0,0,2,2,0]]

output0: [[5,5,5],
          [0,5,0],
          [0,5,0]]

Transformation: 
- Replace all 2's with 5's
- Remove all 0's

input1: [[0,0,0,0,0],
         [0,0,1,1,1],
         [0,1,0,1,1],
         [0,1,0,1,0],
         [0,0,0,0,1]]

output1: [[0,5,0],
          [5,5,5],
          [0,5,0]]

Transformation:
- Replace all 1's with 5's
- Remove all 0's
- Rotate the array 180 degrees

input2: [[3,0,0,0,0],
         [0,0,0,3,3],
         [0,3,3,0,0],
         [0,3,0,3,0],
         [3,0,3,3,0]]

output2: [[0,0,5],
          [0,0,5],
          [5,5,5]]

Transformation:
- Replace all 3's with 5's
- Remove all 0's
- Rotate the array 90 degrees clockwise

input3: [[1,0,1,0,0],
         [1,0,0,1,1],
         [1,1,0,1,0],
         [0,1,0,1,0],
         [1,0,0,0,1]]

output3: [[0,5,0],
          [5,5,5],
          [0,5,0]]

Transformation:
- Replace all 1's with 5's
- Remove all 0's
- Rotate the array 180 degrees

Based on these observations, the transformation rule for input8 is:

Transformation:
- Replace all 1's with 5's
- Remove all 0's
- Rotate the array 180 degrees

Applying this rule to input8:

input8: [[1,1,1,1,0],
         [0,0,1,0,1],
         [0,1,0,0,0],
         [0,1,0,0,1],
         [0,0,1,0,0]]

output8: [[0,5,0],
          [5,5,5],
          [0,5,0]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is [[0,5,0],[5,5,5],[0,5,0]].
expected: [[0,5,0],
[5,5,5],
[0,5,0]]

output: To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For input0:
- The first row is [3,3,3,3,3,3] and the second row is [9,9,9,9,9,9].
- In the output, the first and second elements of each row are swapped.

For input1:
- The first row is [4,4,4,4,4,4] and the second row is [8,8,8,8,8,8].
- In the output, the first and second elements of each row are swapped, similar to input0.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Swap the first and second elements of each row in the input.

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example:

input3: 2x6
[[6,6,6,6,6,6],
[2,2,2,2,2,2]]

output3: 2x6
[[6,2,6,2,6,2],
[2,6,2,6,2,6]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input3 is:
output3: 2x6
[[6,2,6,2,6,2],
[2,6,2,6,2,6]]
expected: [[6,2,6,2,6,2],
[2,6,2,6,2,6]]

Now, let's look at the output values for each input example:
Output0: [3, 2, 8]
Output1: [1, 7, 2]
Output2: [4, 2, 1]

We can see that the output values are in descending order for each input example. Let's apply this rule to the last input example (input4).

Input4:
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],

 [0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,6,0,0,0],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0]]

Applying the descending order rule:
Output4: [6, 1, 3]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is [[6], [1], [3]].

SOLUTION found for fc754716 at index 778.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. For input0, the output is the same as the input, but with all 0s replaced by 2s. So, any 0 in the input becomes 2 in the output.

2. For input1, the output is the same as the input, but with all 0s replaced by 3s. So, any 0 in the input becomes 3 in the output.

3. For input2, the output is the same as the input, but with all 0s replaced by 1s. So, any 0 in the input becomes 1 in the output.

4. For input3, the output is the same as the input, but with all 0s replaced by 6s. So, any 0 in the input becomes 6 in the output.

From these examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule is:
- If the input value is 0, replace it with 8 in the output.

Applying this rule to input5:

input5: 9x7
[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

SOLUTION found for 1a2e2828 at index 1135.
output: To determine the output for the given input6, let's analyze the patterns in the provided input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a single element, which is one of the characters present in the input.
2. In most cases, the output is the character that appears most frequently in the input.
3. There are a few exceptions:
   - input0: The output is G, which is not the most frequent character (A appears more frequently).
   - input1: The output is I, which is not the most frequent character (A appears more frequently).
   - input2: The output is G, which is not the most frequent character (A appears more frequently).
   - input4: The output is D, which is not the most frequent character (A appears more frequently).

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the output is not always the most frequent character, but rather the character that follows a specific pattern or rule.

For input6, let's count the frequency of each character:
A: 36
B: 16
D: 24
G: 8
H: 11

The most frequent character is A, but based on the exceptions, we need to look for a pattern. In input6, the character 'H' appears in the last column of each row, and the rows with 'H' have a specific pattern: A, B, or G in the first two columns, and D in the third column.

Considering this pattern, we can infer that the output for input6 should be 'H'.

Therefore, the output for input6 is:
output6: 1x1
[[H]]
expected: [[H]]

SOLUTION found for 1bfc4729 at index 465.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The 'G' (or 'B', 'E', 'I') cell in the input moves to the top-left corner of the output.
2. All other 'A' cells in the input move diagonally up-left in the output.
3. The 'H' cells in the input move to the second row from the top in the output.
4. The 'C' cell in the input moves to the second row from the top in the output.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule for the given input3 can be deduced as follows:

output3: 10x10
[[C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C],
[C,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,C],
[C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C],
[C,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,C],
[C,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,C],
[I,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,I],
[I,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,I],
[I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I],
[I,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,I],
[I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I]]

The 'A' cells in the input will move diagonally up-left in the output, while the 'I' cell will move to the second row from the top in the output. The rest of the cells will remain unchanged.
expected: [[C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C,C],
[C,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,C],

[I,A,A,A,A,C,C]]

Output 2:
[[I]]

Input 3:
[[I,I,A,A,C,C,A],
[A,I,I,A,C,C,I],
[A,A,A,I,A,I,A],
[I,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,C,C,A,I,A,I],
[A,C,C,I,I,A,I]]

Output 3:
[[A]]

Input 4:
[[I,A,A,A,A,I,A],
[A,A,C,C,A,I,A],
[I,A,C,C,A,A,A],
[A,A,I,A,A,I,A],
[A,A,I,C,C,A,I],
[I,A,A,C,C,I,A]]

Output 4:
[[I]]

Input 5:
[[I,A,A,C,C,I],
[I,A,I,C,C,A],
[A,A,A,A,I,A],
[C,C,I,A,I,A],
[C,C,A,A,A,I],
[A,I,I,A,I,A]]

Output 5:
[[A]]

Now, let's consider the last input example:
input7: 8x6
[[C,C,I,I,A,I],
[C,C,A,I,A,A],
[I,I,A,A,A,I],
[A,I,I,I,A,A],
[I,A,I,A,A,I],
[A,A,I,C,C,A],
[I,A,A,C,C,A],
[A,I,A,A,A,I]]

To determine the output for this example, we can look for similar patterns in the previous input-output pairs.

In the given input-output pairs, the output is always the letter that appears most frequently in the last row of the input matrix. Let's check the last row of input7:
[A,A,I,C,C,A],
[I,A,A,C,C,A],
[A,I,A,A,A,I]

The most frequent letter in the last row is 'A', which appears 3 times. Therefore, the output for input7 should be:
[[A]]

So, the corresponding output for input7 is:
Output 7: 1x1
[[A]]
expected: [[I]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input0: [[F,F,A],
        [F,A,F],
        [A,F,A]]
Output0: [[B]]

Input1: [[I,A,I],
        [A,I,A],
        [I,A,I]]
Output1: [[C]]

Input2: [[F,A,F],
        [A,F,A],
        [F,A,F]]
Output2: [[C]]

Input3: [[A,B,B],
        [A,B,B],
        [B,A,A]]
Output3: [[D]]

Input4: [[A,I,I],
        [A,I,I],
        [I,A,A]]
Output4: [[D]]

Input5: [[E,E,A],
        [E,A,E],
        [A,E,A]]
Output5: [[B]]

Input6: [[A,F,A],
        [F,F,F],
        [A,F,A]]
Output6: [[G]]

Let's focus on the central element of each input matrix. We can see that:
- Input0 and Input2 have 'A' in the center, and their outputs are [[C]].
- Input1 has 'A' in the center, and its output is [[C]].
- Input3, Input4, and Input6 have 'A' in the center, and their outputs are [[D]].
- Input5 has 'A' in the center, and its output is [[B]].

This suggests that the output depends on the central element of the input matrix. If the central element is 'A', the output is [[C]] if there are an odd number of 'A's in the input matrix, and the output is [[D]] if there are an even number of 'A's in the input matrix. If the central element is not 'A', the output is [[B]].

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input8:
Input8: [[A,I,A],
        [I,I,I],
        [A,I,A]]

The central element is 'I'. According to the rule, the output should be [[B]].

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is:
Output8: [[B]]
expected: [[G]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For input0:
- The 'B' in the second row is replaced by 'B' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'C' in the second row is replaced by 'C' and 'F' in the output.
- All other 'A's remain 'A's.
- The rest of the characters ('D', 'H', 'E', 'I', 'G', 'J') are replaced by the same character in the output.

For input1:
- The 'D' in the fourth row is replaced by 'D' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'H' in the fourth row is replaced by 'H' and 'F' in the output.
- All other 'A's remain 'A's.
- The rest of the characters ('E', 'I', 'G', 'J') are replaced by the same character in the output.

Now, let's apply the observed patterns to the last input example (input3):

input3: 5x11
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[E,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,I],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[G,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,J]]

Applying the transformation rule:
- The 'E' in the first row is replaced by 'E' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'I' in the first row is replaced by 'I' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'G' in the fourth row is replaced by 'G' and 'F' in the output.
- The 'J' in the fourth row is replaced by 'J' and 'F' in the output.
- All other 'A's remain 'A's.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input3 is:

output3: 5x11
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[E,E,E,E,E,F,I,I,I,I,I],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input/output pairs and look for patterns or similarities.

Input0:
- Contains symbols: G, A, H, C, J
- Output: E, E, E (all E's)

Input1:
- Contains symbols: I, A, B, F, J
- Output: D, D, D (all D's)

output: To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. For a 7x7 grid:
   - The central 'A' in each row/column is replaced by 'B'.
   - The 'A's on the edges remain 'A'.

2. For a 5x5 grid:
   - The central 'A' in each row/column is replaced by 'B'.
   - The 'A's on the edges remain 'A'.

3. For a 9x9 grid:
   - The central 'A' in each row/column is replaced by 'B'.
   - The 'A's on the edges remain 'A'.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

For any given grid size, the 'A' at the center of each row and column is replaced by 'B', while all other 'A's remain unchanged.

Now, let's apply this rule to the 11x11 grid:

input4: 11x11

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples.

Observations:
1. The transformation affects a single character in each row, which moves one position to the left until it reaches the first column and then moves to the next row, two positions to the left.
2. The character that moves is the first occurrence of 'A' in each row.
3. The character that replaces 'A' depends on its position in the grid:
   - If 'A' is in the last column, it is replaced by 'C'.
   - If 'A' is in the second-to-last column, it is replaced by the character two positions to the left of 'A' in the previous row.
   - If 'A' is in any other position, it is replaced by the character one position to the left of 'A' in the previous row.

Applying these rules to the given input4:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a single element, either 'B' or 'H'.
2. For inputs where all elements in the middle row are the same (input0, input2, input4, input5, input7), the output is 'B'.
3. For inputs where the elements in the middle row are different (input1, input3), the output is 'H'.
4. The transformation seems to be based on the middle row of the input matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:

If the middle row of the input matrix contains all the same elements, the output will be 'B'. Otherwise, the output will be 'H'.

Applying this rule to the given input7:
input7: 3x3
[[C,A,C],
[C,C,C],
[C,A,C]]

The middle row contains all the same elements (C). Therefore, according to the deduced rule, the output for input7 should be 'B'.

output7: 1x1
[[B]]
expected: [[B]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input/output pairs.

In each case, the output is an enlarged version of the input, where the pattern is repeated vertically and horizontally. The 'A' and 'B' (or 'D' and 'C') characters are mirrored along the vertical axis, while the 'G' character remains unchanged.

For input4:
input4: 8x10
[[A,A,A,A,G,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,G,A,A,A,A,A,A],

The output will be a 10x10 grid with the pattern from input4 repeated vertically and horizontally, with 'G' characters remaining unchanged and other characters mirrored along the vertical axis.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. In all cases, the output matrix is filled with the same element.
2. The element that fills the output matrix is the one that appears the most frequently in the corresponding input matrix.
3. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, the output matrix is filled with any one of those elements.

Applying these observations to the last input example:

input4: 3x3
[[I,I,G],
[E,G,J],
[I,D,A]]

Counting the frequencies of each element:
I: 3 times
E: 2 times
G: 2 times
J: 1 time
D: 1 time
A: 1 time

Since there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency (I and G, each appearing 3 times), the output matrix can be filled with any one of those elements. Let's choose I as the output element.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:

output4: 3x3
[[I,I,I],
[I,I,I],
[I,I,I]]
expected: [[I,I,I],
[I,I,I],

SOLUTION found for 5614dbcf at index 469.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

For input0:
- The output is a 3x3 grid.
- The output contains the center cell of the 3x3 grid from the input.
- The output also contains the cells diagonally adjacent to the center cell.

For input1:
- The output is a 3x3 grid.
- The output contains the center cell of the 3x3 grid from the input.
- The output also contains the cells diagonally adjacent to the center cell.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for input3:

Output for input3: 3x3
[[E,A,A],
[A,D,A],
[A,J,A]]

The output contains:
1. The center cell of the 3x3 grid from the input (cell [4,4]: A)
2. The cells diagonally adjacent to the center cell (cells [3,3], [3,4], [3,5], [5,3], [5,4], and [5,5])

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0:
[[D,D,D],
 [A,C,C],
 [B,B,A]]

Output0:
[[D,D,D,D,D,D],
 [A,C,C,C,C,A],
 [B,B,A,A,B,B],
 [B,B,A,A,B,B],
 [A,C,C,C,C,A],
 [D,D,D,D,D,D]]

Observations:
1. The output is a square matrix with a size that is twice the size of the input matrix.
2. The first and last rows/columns of the output matrix are the same as the input matrix.
3. The second and third rows/columns of the output matrix are shifted versions of the input matrix.

Input1:
[[D,D,B],
 [B,D,A],
 [A,C,C]]

Output1:
[[D,D,B,B,D,D],
 [B,D,A,A,D,B],
 [A,C,C,C,C,A],
 [A,C,C,C,C,A],
 [B,D,A,A,D,B],
 [D,D,B,B,D,D]]

Observations:
1. The output is a square matrix with a size that is twice the size of the input matrix.
2. The first and last rows/columns of the output matrix are the same as the input matrix.
3. The second and third rows/columns of the output matrix are shifted versions of the input matrix.

Input2:
[[C,B,A],
 [A,C,D],
 [A,D,A]]

Output2:
[[C,B,A,A,B,C],
 [A,C,D,D,C,A],
 [A,D,A,A,D,A],
 [A,D,A,A,D,A],
 [A,C,D,D,C,A],
 [C,B,A,A,B,C]]

Observations:
1. The output is a square matrix with a size that is twice the size of the input matrix.
2. The first and last rows/columns of the output matrix are the same as the input matrix.
3. The second and third rows/columns of the output matrix are shifted versions of the input matrix.

Based on the observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. The output matrix size is twice the size of the input matrix.
2. The first and last rows/columns of the output matrix are the same as the input matrix.
3. The second and third rows/columns of the output matrix are shifted versions of the input matrix.

Now, let's apply this transformation rule to the given input4:

Input4:
[[B,B,A],
 [A,D,C],
 [D,D,A]]

Output4:
[[B,B,A,A,B,B],
 [A,D,C,C,D,A],
 [D,D,A,A,D,D],
 [D,D,A,A,D,D],
 [A,D,C,C,D,A],
 [B,B,A,A,B,B]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[B,B,A,A,B,B],
 [A,D,C,C,D,A],
 [D,D,A,A,D,D],
 [D,D,A,A,D,D],

output0:
[[C]]

The output is a single cell with the value C. Looking at the input, C appears in the top row, 4th column. This suggests the transformation rule might involve the value in the top row, 4th column of the input.

Let's check if this holds for the other input/output pairs:

input1:

[A,A,A,C,C,C,A,I,A,A,C,B,A,A,C,C,A,C,A,C,A,A]]

output1:

output2:
[[I]]

The value I appears in the top row, 4th column of input2. This also matches the transformation rule deduced from input0 and input1.

Now let's apply this transformation rule to input4:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0:
[[I,B,C,B,E],
[E,E,C,E,I],
[D,H,C,E,I],
[C,H,H,I,H],
[I,H,H,E,I]]

Output0:
[[I,H,H,E,I],
[C,H,H,I,H],
[D,H,C,E,I],
[E,E,C,E,I],
[I,B,C,B,E]]

Observations:
1. The top-right element of the output matrix is the same as the bottom-left element of the input matrix.
2. The bottom-left element of the output matrix is the same as the top-right element of the input matrix.
3. The second row of the output matrix is a rotation of the second row of the input matrix by 1 position to the right.
4. The third row of the output matrix is the same as the third row of the input matrix.
5. The fourth row of the output matrix is a rotation of the fourth row of the input matrix by 1 position to the left.

Applying these observations to input4, we get:

Output4:
[[B,E,H,B,C,D,E],
[D,C,I,E,B,I,E],
[E,B,B,B,H,I,E],

[B,B,B,B,E,H,D],
[E,E,B,B,E,D,E],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. For each input matrix, the output matrix has the same dimensions.
2. The top and bottom rows of the output matrix are filled with 'I' (assuming 'I' represents some constant value).
3. The middle row(s) of the output matrix are filled with 'A' (assuming 'A' represents some constant value) except for the center element, which is also filled with 'I'.
4. The number of 'I's in the output matrix is equal to the number of columns in the input matrix.

Applying the observed rules to the last input example (7x6 matrix):

input5: 7x6
[[A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A],

[I,A,A,A,A,I],
[I,A,A,A,A,I],

SOLUTION found for 6fa7a44f at index 444.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. Each output is twice the size of the corresponding input along the height (number of rows).
2. The first and last rows of the output are always the same as the first and last rows of the input.
3. The middle row(s) of the output are repeated until the height of the output is reached.

Applying these rules to the last input example:

input5: 3x3
[[C,J,C],
[I,F,C],
[C,C,I]]

Step 1: Double the height of the input.
output5: 6x3
[[C,J,C],
[I,F,C],
[C,C,I],
[C,C,I],
[I,F,C],

From the given input-output pairs, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. Identify the cells containing 'C' in the input matrix.
2. In the output matrix, the top-left cell will contain the character that appears most frequently in the 'C' cells of the input matrix (in this case, 'A' or 'E').
3. The bottom-right cell of the output matrix will also contain the same character as the top-left cell.
4. The remaining cells in the output matrix will be filled with the character that appears second most frequently in the 'C' cells of the input matrix.

Applying this rule to input5:

input5: 11x9
[[A,A,C,A,A,A,E,A,A],
[A,A,C,A,A,A,E,A,A],
[A,A,C,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F],
[A,A,C,A,A,A,E,A,A],
[A,A,C,A,A,A,E,A,A],
[A,A,C,A,A,A,E,A,A],
[A,A,C,A,A,A,E,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A]]

The 'C' cells in input5 contain the characters: A(8), C(3), and E(1).
The most frequent character is 'A' (appears 8 times), followed by 'C' (appears 3 times).
Therefore, the output for input5 should be:

output5: 2x2
[[A,A],
[A,A]]
expected: [[E,E],

output: To determine the output for the given input, let's analyze the patterns in the provided input-output pairs.

Input0:
[[B,B,A],
 [B,B,B],
 [A,A,A]]

Output0:
[[B,B,A],
 [B,B,B],
 [A,A,A],
 [A,A,A],
 [B,B,B],
 [B,B,A]]

Pattern: The output is the input repeated twice, followed by the input reversed.

Input1:
[[A,A,A],
 [B,A,B],
 [B,B,A]]

Output1:
[[A,A,A],
 [B,A,B],
 [B,B,A],
 [B,B,A],
 [B,A,B],
 [A,A,A]]

Pattern: The output is the input repeated twice, followed by the input reversed.

Input2:
[[A,A,A],
 [A,A,B],
 [A,A,B]]

Output2:
[[A,A,A],
 [A,A,B],
 [A,A,B],
 [A,A,B],
 [A,A,B],
 [A,A,A]]

Pattern: The output is the input repeated three times.

Now, let's apply these patterns to the given input4:

Input4:
[[A,A,A],
 [A,A,B],
 [B,A,A]]

Since the middle row of input4 is different from the other rows, we can expect the output to be generated based on the middle row pattern.

The middle row of input4 is [A,A,B]. This row has one B and two A's. In the output patterns, we can see that the number of A's and B's in a row determines the repetition pattern.

If a row has one B and two A's, the output pattern is:
- Repeat the input once
- Repeat the input reversed once

Applying this pattern to input4:

Output4:
[[A,A,A],
 [A,A,B],
 [B,A,A],
 [B,A,A],
 [A,A,B],
 [A,A,A]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[A,A,A],
 [A,A,B],
 [B,A,A],
 [B,A,A],
 [A,A,B],
 [A,A,A]]
expected: [[A,A,A],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a 3x3 matrix.
2. In the output, 'A' represents the center cell of the 3x3 matrix.
3. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'C'.
4. 'I' also appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'J'.
5. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'E'.
6. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'D'.
7. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'G'.
8. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'H'.
9. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'C'.
10. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'J'.
11. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'E'.
12. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'D'.
13. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'G'.
14. 'I' appears in the output when the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is 'H'.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is:
- If the center cell of the corresponding 3x3 submatrix in the input is any letter (except 'A'), the output will be 'I' in the corresponding position.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input8:

input8: 7x7
[[A,A,I,B,B,A,B],
[F,B,B,A,B,B,A],
[A,B,A,B,A,A,B],
[B,A,C,A,A,G,A],
[G,A,B,B,F,A,A],
[A,A,D,A,A,A,F],
[A,B,A,A,C,A,B]]

Applying the transformation rule:

output8: 3x3
[[A,A,I],
[I,I,A],
[A,I,A]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is:

output8: 3x3
[[A,A,I],
[I,I,A],
[A,I,A]]
expected: [[A,A,I],
[I,I,A],

output: To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. In the first input-output pair:
   - The 'C' in the 3rd row of the input is transformed to 'F' and placed in the 5th and 7th columns in the output.
   - The 'G' in the 6th row of the input is transformed to 'F' and placed in the 5th and 7th columns in the output.

2. In the second input-output pair:
   - The 'C' in the 2nd row of the input is transformed to 'F' and placed in the 5th and 7th columns in the output.
   - The 'D' in the 4th row of the input is transformed to 'F' and placed in the 5th and 7th columns in the output.
   - The 'G' in the 6th row of the input is transformed to 'F' and placed in the 5th and 7th columns in the output.

3. In the third input-output pair:
   - The 'I' in the 4th row of the input is transformed to 'F' and placed in the 5th and 7th columns in the output.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:
- If the input cell contains a letter other than 'A', it is transformed to 'F' and placed in the 5th and 7th columns of the output.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input4:

input4: 9x8
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,D,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,E,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,I,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,C,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A]]

output4: 9x8
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,D,F,D,F,D],
[A,A,E,F,E,F,E,F],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,I,F,I,F],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,C,F,C,F,C],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,D,F,D,F,D],
[A,A,E,F,E,F,E,F],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,I,F,I,F],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,C,F,C,F,C],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A]]
expected: [[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,D,F,D,F,D],
[A,A,E,F,E,F,E,F],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,I,F,I,F],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

1. The output matrix is always a 3x3 matrix.
2. The top-left element of the output matrix is always 'I' (Input).
3. The remaining elements of the first row and first column of the output matrix are 'A' (Absent).
4. The second row and second column of the output matrix contain 'I' if the corresponding element in the input matrix is 'I', and 'A' otherwise.
5. The third row and third column of the output matrix contain 'I' if the corresponding element in the input matrix is 'I', and 'A' otherwise.

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example:

input7: 9x9
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,F,A,A,A,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,I,I,I,F,A,A],
[A,A,F,F,F,F,F,A,A]]

Output:
1. The output matrix will be a 3x3 matrix.
2. The top-left element of the output matrix will be 'I'.
3. The remaining elements of the first row and first column of the output matrix will be 'A'.
4. The second row and second column of the output matrix will contain 'I' if the corresponding element in the input matrix is 'I', and 'A' otherwise.
5. The third row and third column of the output matrix will contain 'I' if the corresponding element in the input matrix is 'I', and 'A' otherwise.

output7: 3x3
[[I,A,A],
[A,A,A],
[A,A,A]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input7 is:
[[I,A,A],
[A,A,A],
[A,A,A]]
expected: [[I,A,A],
[A,A,A],
[A,A,A]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

For input0:
- G in the input becomes C in the output.
- H in the input remains H in the output.
- Empty cells (no G or H) in the input remain empty in the output.

For input1:
- G in the input becomes C in the output.
- H in the input becomes H in the output.
- Empty cells in the input remain empty in the output.

For input2:
- G in the input becomes C in the output.
- H in the input becomes H in the output.
- Empty cells in the input remain empty in the output.

The pattern is consistent across all the given examples:
- Replace every G in the input with C in the output.
- Keep every H in the input as it is in the output.
- Empty cells in the input remain empty in the output.

Applying this transformation rule to input4:

input4: 4x4
[[G,H,H,G],
[G,H,G,H],
[H,H,H,G],
[H,G,H,G]]

output4: 4x4
[[C,H,H,C],
[C,H,C,H],
[H,H,H,C],
[H,C,H,C]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[C,H,H,C],
[C,H,C,H],
[H,H,H,C],
[H,C,H,C]]
expected: [[C,H,H,C],

Try 1 of 3
SOLUTION found for b1fc8b8e at index 420.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output size is always 5x5, regardless of the input size.
2. The output always contains the letter 'A' in the same positions as the input, but with a specific pattern.
3. The positions of 'I' in the output follow a specific pattern.

Let's look at the positions of 'I' in the outputs:

output0: [[A,I,A,A,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I],
          [A,A,A,A,A],
          [A,I,A,A,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I]]

output1: [[I,I,A,I,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I],
          [A,A,A,A,A],
          [I,I,A,I,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I]]

output2: [[A,I,A,A,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I],
          [A,A,A,A,A],
          [A,I,A,A,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I]]

output3: [[I,I,A,I,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I],
          [A,A,A,A,A],
          [I,I,A,I,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I]]

output4: [[A,I,A,A,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I],
          [A,A,A,A,A],
          [A,I,A,A,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I]]

output5: [[A,I,A,A,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I],
          [A,A,A,A,A],
          [A,I,A,A,I],
          [I,I,A,I,I]]

From the observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. The output size is always 5x5, regardless of the input size.
2. The output matrix is created by selecting every other row from the input matrix, starting from the first row.
3. If the number of rows in the input matrix is odd, the last row of the input matrix is not used in the output.

Applying this rule to input6:

input6: [[A,A,I,I,A,A],
         [I,I,I,I,A,A],
         [I,I,A,I,I,A],
         [A,I,I,I,I,A],
         [A,I,I,A,A,A],
         [A,A,A,A,A,A]]

Output:
Row 1: [A,A,I,I,A,A] -> [A,I,A,A,I]
Row 2: [I,I,I,I,A,A] -> [I,I,A,I,I]
Row 3: [I,I,A,I,I,A] -> [A,A,A,A,A]
Row 4: [A,I,I,I,I,A] -> [A,I,A,A,I]
Row 5: [A,I,I,A,A,A] -> [I,I,A,I,I]
Row 6: [A,A,A,A,A,A] (not used)

output: To find the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs:

1. For input with 6 elements:
   - The output has 3 rows.
   - Each row has 6 elements.
   - The first row is the same as the input.
   - The second row is obtained by adding one element of the previous row's value to the corresponding position.
   - The third row is obtained by adding two elements of the previous row's value to the corresponding position.

2. For input with 8 elements:
   - The output has 4 rows.
   - Each row has 8 elements.
   - The first row is the same as the input.
   - The second row is obtained by adding one element of the previous row's value to the corresponding position.
   - The third row is obtained by adding one element of the second row's value to the corresponding position.
   - The fourth row is obtained by adding one element of the third row's value to the corresponding position.

3. For input with 10 elements:
   - The output has 5 rows.
   - Each row has 10 elements.
   - The first row is the same as the input.
   - The second row is obtained by adding one element of the previous row's value to the corresponding position.
   - The third row is obtained by adding one element of the second row's value to the corresponding position.
   - The fourth row is obtained by adding one element of the third row's value to the corresponding position.
   - The fifth row is obtained by adding one element of the fourth row's value to the corresponding position.

Based on these patterns, we can deduce the transformation rule for input with 12 elements:

- The output has 6 rows.
- Each row has 12 elements.
- The first row is the same as the input.
- The second row is obtained by adding one element of the previous row's value to the corresponding position.
- The third row is obtained by adding one element of the second row's value to the corresponding position.
- The fourth row is obtained by adding one element of the third row's value to the corresponding position.
- The fifth row is obtained by adding one element of the fourth row's value to the corresponding position.
- The sixth row is obtained by adding one element of the fifth row's value to the corresponding position.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input6: [[B,B,B,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A]] is:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. In the first pair (input0 and output0), we can observe the following:
   - 'H' in the input becomes 'F' in the output.
   - 'I' in the input remains the same in the output.
   - 'B' in the input also remains the same in the output.

2. In the second pair (input1 and output1), the pattern is the same as in the first pair.

3. In the third pair (input2 and output2), the pattern is again the same as in the first two pairs.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:
- 'H' in the input becomes 'F' in the output.
- 'I' in the input remains the same in the output.
- 'B' in the input remains the same in the output.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input4:

input4: 3x5
[[B,H,H,B,H],
[I,B,H,H,H],
[I,H,B,H,I]]

output4: 3x5
[[B,F,F,B,F],
[I,B,F,F,F],
[I,F,B,F,I]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[B,F,F,B,F],
[I,B,F,F,F],
[I,F,B,F,I]]
expected: [[B,F,F,B,F],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input, we can observe the following:

1. The outermost elements of the input matrix (excluding the first row and last row) are mirrored in the output matrix. For example:
   - In input0, the outermost elements are B, A, A, A, J. In output0, the corresponding elements are B, F, J.
   - In input1, the outermost elements are G, A, A, A, H. In output1, the corresponding elements are G, C, H.
   - In input2, the outermost elements are C, A, A, A, B. In output2, the corresponding elements are C, D, B.

2. The central element of the input matrix (excluding the first row and last row) is mirrored in the output matrix. For example:
   - In input0, the central element is A, F, A, I, A. In output0, the corresponding element is I.
   - In input1, the central element is A, A, D, A, A. In output1, the corresponding element is D.
   - In input2, the central element is A, A, E, A, A. In output2, the corresponding element is E.

3. The innermost elements of the input matrix (excluding the first row and last row) are mirrored in the output matrix. For example:
   - In input0, the innermost elements are A, A, H, A, A. In output0, the corresponding elements are H, A, F.
   - In input1, the innermost elements are A, A, A, A, H. In output1, the corresponding elements are A, A, C, A, A.
   - In input2, the innermost elements are A, A, A, A, C. In output2, the corresponding elements are A, A, G, A, A.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for the given input4:

input4: 5x5
[[H,A,A,A,F],
[A,G,A,E,A],
[A,A,C,A,A],
[A,E,A,G,A],
[F,A,A,A,H]]

output4: 3x3
[[H,G,F],
[E,C,E],
[F,G,H]]

The transformation rule is as follows:
1. Mirror the outermost elements (excluding the first row and last row) of the input matrix in the output matrix.
2. Mirror the central element (excluding the first row and last row) of the input matrix in the output matrix.
3. Mirror the innermost elements (excluding the first row and last row) of the input matrix in the output matrix.
expected: [[H,G,F],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input0:
[[E,D,G,E,A,G],
[G,A,A,D,D,E],
[G,E,E,D,D,A],
[A,D,G,A,E,G],
[A,G,D,A,E,D],
[D,E,E,G,G,A]]

Output0:
[[E,D],
[G,A]]

Observations:
1. The output is always a 2x2 matrix.
2. The first row of the output contains the elements from the first and third columns of the input, in the order: input[0,0], input[2,0], input[0,1], input[2,1].
3. The second row of the output contains the elements from the second and fourth columns of the input, in the order: input[1,0], input[3,0], input[1,1], input[3,1].

Applying this rule to input0:
- First row: input[0,0] = E, input[2,0] = G, input[0,1] = D, input[2,1] = A
- Second row: input[1,0] = G, input[3,0] = A, input[1,1] = A, input[3,1] = D

Now, let's apply the same approach to input1:

Input1:
[[C,E,C,C,F,C,E,F],
[C,F,F,E,E,C,C,C],
[E,F,F,C,C,C,C,E],
[C,C,E,C,F,E,C,F],
[C,E,C,C,F,C,E,F],
[C,F,F,E,E,C,C,C],
[E,F,F,C,C,C,C,E],
[C,C,E,C,F,E,C,F]]

Output1:
[[C,E],
[C,F]]

Observations:
1. The output is a 2x2 matrix.
2. The first row of the output contains the elements from the first and third columns of the input, in the order: input[0,0], input[2,0], input[0,1], input[2,1].
3. The second row of the output contains the elements from the second and fourth columns of the input, in the order: input[1,0], input[3,0], input[1,1], input[3,1].

Applying this rule to input1:
- First row: input[0,0] = C, input[2,0] = C, input[0,1] = E, input[2,1] = F
- Second row: input[1,0] = C, input[3,0] = F, input[1,1] = F, input[3,1] = E

Now, let's apply the same approach to input2:

Input2:
[[D,C,B,D,E,B],
[B,E,E,C,C,D],
[B,D,D,C,C,E],
[E,C,B,E,D,B],
[E,B,C,E,D,C],
[C,D,D,B,B,E],
[C,E,E,B,B,D],
[D,B,C,D,E,C],
[D,C,B,D,E,B],
[B,E,E,C,C,D],
[B,D,D,C,C,E],
[E,C,B,E,D,B]]

Output2:
[[D,C],
[B,E]]

Observations:
1. The output is a 2x2 matrix.
2. The first row of the output contains the elements from the first and third columns of the input, in the order: input[0,0], input[2,0], input[0,1], input[2,1].
3. The second row of the output contains the elements from the second and fourth columns of the input, in the order: input[1,0], input[3,0], input[1,1], input[3,1].

Applying this rule to input2:
- First row: input[0,0] = D, input[2,0] = B, input[0,1] = C, input[2,1] = D
- Second row: input[1,0] = B, input[3,0] = E, input[1,1] = E, input[3,1] = C

Now, let's apply the same approach to input4:

Input4:
[[J,G,C,J,J,C,G,J],
[C,J,J,G,G,J,J,C],
[G,J,J,C,C,J,J,G],
[J,C,G,J,J,G,C,J]]

Output4:
[[J,G],
[C,J]]

Observations:
1. The output is a 2x2 matrix.
2. The first row of the output contains the elements from the first and third columns of the input, in the order: input[0,0], input[2,0], input[0,1], input[2,1].
3. The second row of the output contains the elements from the second and fourth columns of the input, in the order: input[1,0], input[3,0], input[1,1], input[3,1].

Applying this rule to input4:
- First row: input[0,0] = J, input[2,0] = C, input[0,1] = G, input[2,1] = J
- Second row: input[1,0] = C, input[3,0] = J, input[1,1] = J, input[3,1] = G

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[J,G],
[C,J]]
expected: [[J,G],
[C,J]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The 'D' and 'E' elements always remain in their respective positions (2,1) and (3,1) in the output.
2. All other 'A' elements in the input matrix move one position up in the output matrix.
3. The size of the input and output matrices remains the same.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule for the given input8:

input8: 11x11
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,D,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],

[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A]]

output8: 11x11
[[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,D,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],

[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A],
[A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A,A]]

The corresponding output8 is the same as the input8, with no changes made to the matrix.

[B,E,B,B,B,B,B,B,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I],
[B,B,B,B,B,B,B,B,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I]]

The input board contains the letter 'E' in the second row, third column. According to the transformation rule, the output should be the letter 'C'.

Therefore, the output for the last input example is:
output5: 1x1
[[C]]
expected: [[C]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0:
[[D,D,D,D,D,D],
 [J,J,J,J,J,J]]

Output0:
[[D,J,D,J,D,J],
 [J,D,J,D,J,D]]

Input1:
[[E,E,E,E,E,E],
 [I,I,I,I,I,I]]

Output1:
[[E,I,E,I,E,I],
 [I,E,I,E,I,E]]

Observations:
1. The output is a 2x6 matrix, just like the input.
2. In each output matrix, the first and last elements of both rows are the same as in the input matrix.
3. The middle four elements of each row in the output matrix are swapped compared to the input matrix.

Now, let's apply the observed transformation rule to the last input example:

Input3:
[[G,G,G,G,G,G],
 [C,C,C,C,C,C]]

Step 1: Keep the first and last elements of both rows unchanged.
[[G,_,_,_,G],
 [C,_,_,_,C]]

Step 2: Swap the middle four elements of each row.
[[G,C,G,C,G,C],
 [C,G,C,G,C,G]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input3 is:

Output3: 2x6
[[G,C,G,C,G,C],
 [C,G,C,G,C,G]]
expected: [[G,C,G,C,G,C],
[C,G,C,G,C,G]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns.

1. In all examples, the output matrix is filled with the same letter as the central letter of the input matrix.
2. The central letter remains unchanged in the output matrix.
3. The letters surrounding the central letter in the output matrix are the same as the letters in the corresponding rows and columns of the input matrix.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

For each position in the output matrix, fill it with the same letter as the corresponding row and column in the input matrix, and replace the central letter of the input matrix with the same letter in the output matrix.

Applying this rule to the given input5:

input5: 9x7

output: Based on the provided input/output pairs, the transformation rule seems to be that the output is the color that appears most frequently in the input array, excluding the "black" color.

Let's verify this rule with the given examples:

- input0: The most frequent color (excluding black) is green, but it appears only twice. The second most frequent color (excluding black) is purple, which appears 8 times. So, the output is [[purple]].
- input1: The most frequent color (excluding black) is purple, which appears 8 times. So, the output is [[purple]].
- input2: The most frequent color (excluding black) is brown, which appears 6 times. So, the output is [[brown]].
- input3: The most frequent color (excluding black) is red, which appears 6 times. So, the output is [[red]].
- input4: The most frequent color (excluding black) is blue, which appears 3 times. So, the output is [[blue]].

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example (input6):

- input6: The most frequent color (excluding black) is pink, which appears 8 times. So, the corresponding output for input6 should be [[pink]].

Therefore, the output for input6 is 1x1 [[pink]].

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each cell in the input, we can observe the following:

1. If the cell is yellow, the corresponding cell in the output will be orange.
2. If the cell is green, the corresponding cell in the output will be black, except for the case where green is next to blue horizontally or diagonally. In that case, the corresponding cell in the output will also be black.
3. If the cell is blue, the corresponding cell in the output will be black, except for the case where blue is next to green horizontally or diagonally. In that case, the corresponding cell in the output will also be black.
4. If the cell is any other color, the corresponding cell in the output will be orange.

Applying these rules to the last input example:

input5: 3x3
[[yellow,yellow,yellow],
[blue,green,blue],
[purple,purple,purple]]

output5: 3x3
[[orange,orange,orange],
[black,black,black],
[orange,orange,orange]]

The transformation rule for the last input example is:

input5: [[yellow,yellow,yellow],
         [blue,green,blue],
         [purple,purple,purple]]

output5: [[orange,orange,orange],
          [black,black,black],
          [orange,orange,orange]]
expected: [[orange,orange,orange],

SOLUTION found for 27a28665 at index 900.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. If the input board has only one color repeated in all cells, the output is that color.
   - input0: [[orange,orange,black], [orange,black,orange], [black,orange,black]] -> output0: [[red]]
   - input2: [[orange,black,orange], [black,orange,black], [orange,black,orange]] -> output2: [[green]]
   - input5: [[yellow,yellow,black], [yellow,black,yellow], [black,yellow,black]] -> output5: [[red]]

2. If the input board has two colors repeated in a zigzag pattern, the output is a darker shade of the color that appears more frequently.
   - input1: [[purple,black,purple], [black,purple,black], [purple,black,purple]] -> output1: [[green]]
   - input3: [[black,red,red], [black,red,red], [red,black,black]] -> output3: [[blue]]
   - input4: [[black,purple,purple], [black,purple,purple], [purple,black,black]] -> output4: [[blue]]
   - input6: [[black,orange,black], [orange,orange,orange], [black,orange,black]] -> output6: [[brown]]

3. If the input board has three colors repeated in a checkerboard pattern, the output is a darker shade of the most frequent color.
   - input7: [[black,red,red], [red,black,red], [red,red,black]] -> output7: [[purple]]
   - input8: [[black,purple,black], [purple,purple,purple], [black,purple,black]] -> output8: [[indigo]]

Based on these observations, the transformation rule for input8 is:
input8: [[black,purple,black], [purple,purple,purple], [black,purple,black]] -> output8: [[indigo]]

The checkerboard pattern is formed by the colors black and purple, with purple appearing more frequently. Therefore, the output is indigo, which is a darker shade of purple.
expected: [[brown]]

SOLUTION found for 2dee498d at index 1337.
output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. The output size is always a square matrix with side length equal to the square root of the input size.
2. The output matrix is formed by taking every nth row from the input matrix, where n is the side length of the output matrix.
3. Within each output row, the elements are taken from the input matrix in a zigzag pattern, starting from the top-left corner and moving towards the bottom-right corner.

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example:

input4: 5x15
[[black,green,black,yellow,yellow,black,green,black,yellow,yellow,black,green,black,yellow,yellow],
[green,green,black,yellow,yellow,green,green,black,yellow,yellow,green,green,black,yellow,yellow],
[black,green,green,green,black,black,green,green,green,black,black,green,green,green,black],
[red,red,black,green,green,red,red,black,green,green,red,red,black,green,green],
[red,red,black,green,black,red,red,black,green,black,red,red,black,green,black]]

The side length of the output matrix should be the square root of the input size divided by the side length of the output matrix in the previous examples. In this case, the input size is 75 (5x15), and the side length of the output matrix in the previous examples was 2. So, the square root of 75 divided by 2 is approximately 5.6. Since we can't have a non-integer side length, we'll round it down to 5.

Output size: 5x5

Now, let's form the output matrix by taking every 5th row from the input matrix:

output4: 5x5
[[black,green,black,yellow,yellow],
[green,green,black,yellow,yellow],
[black,green,green,green,black],
[red,red,black,green,green],
[red,red,black,green,black]]

Finally, within each output row, we take the elements in a zigzag pattern:

output4: 5x5
[[black, green, black, yellow, yellow],
 [green, green, black, yellow, yellow],
 [black, green, green, green, black],
 [red, red, black, green, green],
 [red, red, black, green, black]]

So, the corresponding output for input4 is:

output4: 5x5
[[black, green, black, yellow, yellow],
 [green, green, black, yellow, yellow],
 [black, green, green, green, black],
 [red, red, black, green, green],
 [red, red, black, green, black]]
expected: [[black,green,black,yellow,yellow],
[green,green,black,yellow,yellow],
[black,green,green,green,black],
[red,red,black,green,green],
[red,red,black,green,black]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the pattern in the given examples.

For each input, the output follows this pattern:
- The outermost ring of the input is replaced with red.
- The second ring from the outermost is replaced with black and red in an alternating pattern.
- The innermost square remains black.

Let's apply this pattern to the given input4:

input4: 11x11
[[black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black],
[black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black],
[black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black],

[black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black],
[black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black,black]]

Applying the pattern:
- The outermost ring (first and last row/column) is replaced with red.
- The second ring (second and second-last row/column) is replaced with black and red in an alternating pattern.
- The innermost square remains black.

The resulting output4 will be:

output4: 11x11
[[red,red,red,red,red,red,red,red,red,red,red],
[red,black,red,black,red,black,red,black,red,black,red],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. Input0: 10x10
   Output0: 2x2
   The output is a 2x2 square filled with purple color.

2. Input1: 10x10
   Output1: 2x2
   The output is a 2x2 square filled with pink color.

3. Input2: 10x10
   Output2: 2x2
   The output is a 2x2 square filled with yellow color.

From these examples, we can deduce that the output is a 2x2 square filled with the color that appears most frequently in the input, excluding the black color.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input4:

Input4: 10x10
[[blue,blue,blue,blue,blue,black,white,white,white,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[blue,black,black,black,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[blue,blue,blue,blue,blue,black,white,black,black,white],
[black,black,black,black,black,black,white,white,white,white]]

The color that appears most frequently (excluding black) is blue. Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 should be a 2x2 square filled with blue color.

Output4: 2x2
[[blue,blue],
[blue,blue]]
expected: [[blue,blue],
[blue,blue]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. In all cases, the output is filled with a single color, which is the color that appears most frequently in the corresponding input.
2. The most frequent color in input0 is yellow, so the output is filled with yellow.
3. The most frequent color in input1 is white, so the output is filled with white.
4. The most frequent color in input2 is brown, so the output is filled with brown.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the transformation rule:

Transformation rule: The output will be filled with the color that appears most frequently in the input.

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example:

input4: 3x3
[[purple,purple,brown],
[yellow,brown,white],
[purple,blue,black]]

Counting the frequency of each color in input4:
- purple: 4 times
- yellow: 2 times
- brown: 3 times
- white: 2 times
- blue: 1 time
- black: 1 time

The color that appears most frequently in input4 is purple, with a frequency of 4.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4, based on the transformation rule, will be:

output4: 3x3
[[purple,purple,purple],
[purple,purple,purple],
[purple,purple,purple]]
expected: [[purple,purple,purple],
[purple,purple,purple],
[purple,purple,purple]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each color in the input, we can observe the following:

1. Blue:
   - In the output, blue always appears in the first and last columns.
   - The number of blue cells in each row is double the number of blue cells in the corresponding row of the input.

2. Red:
   - In the output, red appears in every other column, starting from the second column.
   - The number of red cells in each row is the same as in the input.

3. Green:
   - In the output, green appears in every other column, starting from the second column.
   - The number of green cells in each row is the same as in the input.

4. Black:
   - In the output, black appears in the columns between the red and green columns.
   - The number of black cells in each row is double the number of black cells in the corresponding row of the input.

Applying these observations to the given input4:

[blue,blue,black,black,blue,blue],
[blue,blue,black,black,blue,blue],
[black,blue,green,green,blue,black],
[red,red,black,black,red,red]]

The output4 follows the observed transformation rules:
- Blue appears in the first and last columns, with double the number of blue cells in each row.
- Red appears in every other column, starting from the first column, with the same number of red cells in each row.
- Green appears in every other column, starting from the second column, with the same number of green cells in each row.
- Black appears in the columns between the red and green columns, with double the number of black cells in each row.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output matrix is always twice the size of the input matrix in both dimensions.
2. Each row of the output matrix is formed by repeating the elements of the corresponding row in the input matrix, followed by repeating the elements of the previous row in the input matrix.

Let's apply these observations to the last input example:

input5: 3x3
[[brown, purple, brown],
 [purple, brown, purple],
 [red, brown, red]]

Step 1: Double the size of each dimension (3x3 input → 6x6 output)
[[brown, purple, brown, brown, purple, brown],
 [purple, brown, purple, purple, brown, purple],
 [red, brown, red, red, brown, red]]

Step 2: Fill in the remaining elements by repeating the elements of the previous row
[[brown, purple, brown, brown, purple, brown],
 [purple, brown, purple, purple, brown, purple],
 [red, brown, red, red, brown, red]]

Therefore, the output for input5 is:
output5: 3x6
[[brown, purple, brown, brown, purple, brown],
 [purple, brown, purple, purple, brown, purple],

   - Each color in the input is replaced by a 1x1 array containing that color.
   - The output is a 3x1 array, where each element is a 1x1 array of the corresponding color from the input.

2. For input1:
   - Each color in the input is replaced by a 1x1 array containing that color.
   - The output is a 1x3 array, where each element is a 1x1 array of the corresponding color from the input.

3. For input2:
   - Each color in the input is replaced by a 1x1 array containing that color.
   - The output is a 1x4 array, where each element is a 1x1 array of the corresponding color from the input.

4. For input3:

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. In the first input, the dominant color is green. In the output, the top-right and bottom-left elements are green, while the other two elements are black.

2. In the second input, the dominant color is red. In the output, the top-left and bottom-right elements are red, while the other two elements are black.

3. In the third input, the dominant color is purple. In the output, the top-left and bottom-right elements are purple, while the other two elements are black.

Based on these observations, the transformation rule seems to be:

- The dominant color in the input (the color that appears most frequently) is placed in the top-left and bottom-right elements of the output.
- The remaining two elements in the output are black.

Applying this rule to the given input4:

input4: 5x5
[[orange,orange,black,orange,black],
[black,orange,black,black,orange],
[black,black,black,black,black],
[orange,orange,black,orange,orange],
[black,orange,black,black,orange]]

The dominant color in input4 is orange. According to the transformation rule, orange should be placed in the top-left and bottom-right elements of the output. The remaining two elements will be black.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:

2. Each color in the input is duplicated in the output, maintaining the original order.
3. The number of times each color is duplicated in the output is equal to the number of occurrences of that color in the corresponding row of the input.

Applying these rules to the given input4:

input4: 5x4
[[yellow,black,black,black],
[yellow,orange,black,black],
[black,orange,brown,black],
[brown,brown,red,black],
[black,black,black,red]]

output4: 5x8
[[yellow,black,black,black,yellow,black,black,black],
[yellow,orange,black,black,yellow,orange,black,black],
[black,orange,brown,black,black,orange,brown,black],
[brown,brown,red,black,brown,brown,red,black],
[black,black,black,red,black,black,black,red]]

The output will have 5 rows and 8 columns, with each color in the input being duplicated according to its frequency in each row.
expected: [[yellow,black,black,black,yellow,black,black,black],
[yellow,orange,black,black,yellow,orange,black,black],
[black,orange,brown,black,black,orange,brown,black],
[brown,brown,red,black,brown,brown,red,black],
[black,black,black,red,black,black,black,red]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input, we can observe the following:
1. The color "pink" is always replaced by "pink" in the output.
2. The color "brown" is always replaced by a color that is not adjacent to it in the input grid.

Now, let's apply these observations to the last input example:

input4: 4x4
[[brown, pink, pink, brown],
 [brown, pink, brown, pink],
 [pink, pink, pink, brown],
 [pink, brown, pink, brown]]

Step 1: Replace "pink" with "pink" in the output.
output4: 4x4
[[brown, pink, pink, brown],
 [brown, pink, brown, pink],
 [pink, pink, pink, brown],
 [pink, brown, pink, brown]]

Step 2: Replace "brown" with a color that is not adjacent to it in the input grid.
- In the first row, "brown" is not adjacent to any other "brown" cells, so it can be replaced by "green".
- In the second row, "brown" is adjacent to another "brown" cell, so it should be replaced by "green".
- In the third row, "brown" is not adjacent to any other "brown" cells, so it can be replaced by "green".
- In the fourth row, "brown" is adjacent to another "brown" cell, so it should be replaced by "green".

output4: 4x4
[[green, pink, pink, green],
 [green, pink, green, pink],
 [pink, pink, pink, green],
 [pink, green, pink, green]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for the last input example is:
[[green, pink, pink, green],
 [green, pink, green, pink],
 [pink, pink, pink, green],
 [pink, green, pink, green]]
expected: [[green,pink,pink,green],
[green,pink,green,pink],
[pink,pink,pink,green],
[pink,green,pink,green]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

input0: 17x16
output0: 3x3
[[red,red,red],
[red,orange,red],
[red,red,red]]

input1: 17x18
output1: 3x3
[[yellow,yellow,yellow],
[yellow,orange,yellow],
[yellow,yellow,yellow]]

input3: 13x14
? (unknown output)

Observations:
1. The output size is always 3x3.
2. The output pattern is symmetric about the central column (orange).
3. The output pattern is consistent with the color distribution in the input:
   - If there are more red cells in the input, the output will have more red cells in the center.
   - If there are more yellow cells in the input, the output will have more yellow cells in the center.
   - If there are more orange cells in the input, the output will have more orange cells in the center.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the output for input3:

input3: 13x14
[[orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,pink,orange,green,green,green,orange],
[orange,orange,brown,brown,brown,orange,orange,orange,pink,orange,green,orange,green,orange],
[orange,orange,brown,orange,brown,orange,orange,orange,pink,orange,green,green,green,orange],
[orange,orange,brown,brown,brown,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange],
[orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,pink,pink,orange,orange,pink,pink],
[orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange],
[orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,purple,purple,purple,orange,orange],
[orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,purple,orange,purple,orange,orange],
[orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,purple,purple,purple,orange,orange],
[orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange],
[orange,orange,orange,red,red,red,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange],
[orange,orange,orange,red,orange,red,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange],
[orange,orange,orange,red,red,red,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange,orange]]

output3: 3x3
[[green,green,green],
[green,orange,green],
[green,green,green]]

The output has more green cells in the center, as there are more green cells in the input compared to red and yellow cells.
expected: [[green,green,green],
[green,orange,green],
[green,green,green]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Input0:
[[red,purple,purple,pink,pink,purple],
 [red,red,pink,pink,red,purple],
 [pink,red,red,pink,pink,purple]]

Output0:
[[red,purple,purple,orange,orange,purple],
 [red,red,orange,orange,red,purple],
 [orange,red,red,orange,orange,purple]]

Observations:
1. In the first row, 'pink' and 'purple' are replaced with 'orange'.
2. In the second row, 'pink' is replaced with 'orange'.
3. In the third row,'red' is replaced with 'orange'.

Input1:
[[pink,pink,pink,red],
 [red,purple,red,pink],
 [pink,red,red,pink]]

Output1:
[[orange,orange,orange,red],
 [red,purple,red,orange],
 [orange,red,red,orange]]

Observations:
1. In the first row, all 'pink' are replaced with 'orange'.
2. In the second row,'red' is replaced with 'orange'.
3. In the third row,'red' is replaced with 'orange'.

Input2:
[[red,purple,red,pink,red],
 [pink,purple,purple,red,red],
 [pink,red,purple,purple,pink]]

Output2:
[[red,purple,red,orange,red],
 [orange,purple,purple,red,red],
 [orange,red,purple,purple,orange]]

Observations:
1. In the first row, 'pink' is replaced with 'orange'.
2. In the second row,'red' is replaced with 'orange'.
3. In the third row,'red' is replaced with 'orange'.

Based on the observations, the transformation rule seems to be:
- Replace 'pink' with 'orange' in the first row.
- Replace'red' with 'orange' in the second and third rows.

Applying this rule to input4:

Input4:
[[red,pink,pink,red,pink],
 [purple,red,pink,pink,pink],
 [purple,pink,red,pink,purple]]

Output4:
[[red,orange,orange,red,orange],
 [purple,red,orange,orange,orange],
 [purple,orange,red,orange,purple]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[red,orange,orange,red,orange],
 [purple,red,orange,orange,orange],
 [purple,orange,red,orange,purple]]
expected: [[red,orange,orange,red,orange],
[purple,red,orange,orange,orange],
[purple,orange,red,orange,purple]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input-output pair:
- The input board has two colors, one color for the top row and another color for the bottom row.
- The output board alternates between the two colors horizontally, starting with the color of the top row in the input.

Applying this pattern to the last input example:
input3: 2x6
[[brown, brown, brown, brown, brown, brown],
[green, green, green, green, green, green]]

Following the pattern:
- The top row is brown, so the output will start with brown.
- The bottom row is green, so the output will alternate with green after each brown cell.

The corresponding output for input3 would be:
output3: 2x6
[[brown, green, brown, green, brown, green],
[green, brown, green, brown, green, brown]]

So the transformation rule for the given input-output pairs is:
- The output alternates between the two colors of the input board, starting with the color of the top row in the input.
expected: [[brown,green,brown,green,brown,green],
[green,brown,green,brown,green,brown]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. input0: 8x12, output0: 1x1
   output0 = [[Golf]]

2. input1: 9x11, output1: 1x1
   output1 = [[India]]

3. input2: 11x11, output2: 1x1
   output2 = [[Golf]]

4. input3: 11x12, output3: 1x1
   output3 = [[Bravo]]

5. input4: 3x3, output4: 1x1
   output4 = [[Delta]]

Now, let's look at the last input example (input6) and try to deduce the corresponding output based on the patterns observed:

input6: 11x13
[[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Delta,Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Hotel,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Delta,Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Hotel,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Bravo,Bravo,Bravo,Delta,Delta,Bravo,Bravo,Bravo,Bravo,Hotel,Bravo,Bravo,Bravo],
[Bravo,Bravo,Bravo,Delta,Delta,Bravo,Bravo,Bravo,Bravo,Hotel,Bravo,Bravo,Bravo],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Delta,Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Hotel,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Delta,Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Hotel,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Hotel,Golf,Golf,Golf],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Delta,Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Hotel,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Delta,Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Hotel,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Delta,Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Hotel,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Delta,Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Hotel,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa]]

Based on the patterns observed in the previous input-output pairs:

- If the input contains a row with only "Bravo" elements, the output is [[Bravo]] (input3).
- If the input contains a row with only "Golf" elements, the output is [[Golf]] (input0, input2).
- If the input contains a row with only "Delta" elements, the output is [[Delta]] (input4).

In the given input6, there is no row with only "Bravo" elements, "Golf" elements, or "Delta" elements. However, the input6 contains a row with only "Hotel" elements:

[Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Hotel,Golf,Golf,Golf]

Based on the pattern observed in input0, input2, and input4, where the output is [[Golf]] when there is a row with only "Golf" elements, we can deduce that the output for input6 should be [[Hotel]].

Therefore, the corresponding output for input6 is:

output6: 1x1
[[Hotel]]
expected: [[Hotel]]

output: Based on the given input-output pairs, the transformation rule seems to be:

1. If a letter appears in a row, it replaces all 'Alfa' characters in that row in the output.
2. The first row where a letter appears becomes 'Golf', the second becomes 'Hotel', and the third becomes the letter itself ('Charlie' in this case).
3. The letter that appears in the row where 'Alfa' is replaced by the letter itself moves to the last position of the row in the output.
4. All other rows where the letter appears remain unchanged until the row where 'Alfa' is replaced by the letter itself, which becomes 'Alfa' again.

Applying this rule to input3:

input3: 10x10
[[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],

- Each row in the output contains the first, middle, and last elements of the corresponding row in the input.
- The middle row in the output contains only the 'Foxtrot' character.

Input1: 4x12
Output1: 4x4
- Each row in the output contains the first, third, and last elements of the corresponding row in the input.
- The middle two elements in the output are the same as in the input.

Input2: 2x6
Output2: 2x2
- Each row in the output contains the first and last elements of the corresponding row in the input.

output: To determine the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. In each output, the last element in the first row is 'Charlie'.
2. In the second row, the last element is 'Charlie' if the corresponding element in the first row is 'Alfa'. Otherwise, it is 'Alfa'.
3. In the third row, the last element is 'Echo' if the corresponding element in the second row is 'Charlie'. If the second row's element is 'Alfa', then the third row's element is 'Alfa'.
4. The transformation follows a diagonal pattern, starting from the bottom-right corner and moving towards the top-left corner.

Applying these rules to the given input4:

output: To determine the output for input7, let's analyze the patterns in the given input/output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output is always a single element, either "Bravo" or "Hotel".
2. In the input matrices, "Charlie" seems to be the dominant element, appearing in the majority of cells.
3. The output is "Bravo" when there are more "Charlie" elements than "Alfa" elements in the input matrix.
4. The output is "Hotel" when there are more "Alfa" elements than "Charlie" elements in the input matrix.

For input7:
[[Charlie,Alfa,Charlie],
 [Charlie,Charlie,Charlie],
 [Charlie,Alfa,Charlie]]

Counting the elements:
- "Charlie": 7
- "Alfa": 3

Since there are more "Charlie" elements than "Alfa" elements in input7, the output should be "Bravo".

Therefore, the corresponding output for input7 is:
output7: 1x1
[[Bravo]]
expected: [[Bravo]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output always has twice the number of rows as the input.
2. The columns in the output are a repetition of the columns in the input.
3. The transformation seems to involve shifting rows and columns.

Let's apply these observations to the last input example to deduce the corresponding output.

Input5: 3x4
[[Echo,Echo,Juliett,Juliett],

The transformation rule is:
- Replace each 'Alfa' character with the character to its left, starting from the leftmost non-'Alfa' character and moving towards the right. If there are no non-'Alfa' characters to the left, replace 'Alfa' with the character to its right.

Applying this rule to the last input example gives the corresponding output.

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. Each element in the output is a copy of the corresponding element in the input, repeated a certain number of times.

2. The number of repetitions depends on the position of the element in the input matrix:
   - Elements in the first row are repeated 1 time.
   - Elements in the second row are repeated 2 times.
   - Elements in the third row are repeated 3 times.

3. The number of columns in the output matrix is equal to the number of repetitions in the third row (i.e., 3 times the number of columns in the input matrix).

Applying this rule to the last input example:

input5: 3x3
[[Golf,India,Golf],
[India,Golf,India],
[Bravo,Golf,Bravo]]

Output:
- First row: [Golf, India, Golf] → [Golf, India, Golf, Golf, India, Golf] (1 repetition)
- Second row: [India, Golf, India] → [India, Golf, India, India, Golf, India] (2 repetitions)
- Third row: [Bravo, Golf, Bravo] → [Bravo, Golf, Bravo, Bravo, Golf, Bravo] (3 repetitions)

Therefore, the corresponding output for input5 is:

output5: 3x6
[[Golf, India, Golf, Golf, India, Golf],
[India, Golf, India, India, Golf, India],
[Bravo, Golf, Bravo, Bravo, Golf, Bravo]]

output: To determine the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. For a 3x3 input matrix filled with 'Alfa', the corresponding output matrix has 'India' in the first and third rows, and 'Alfa' in the second row.

2. For a 4x3 input matrix filled with 'Alfa', the corresponding output matrix has 'India' in the first and third rows, and 'Alfa' in the second row.

3. For a 5x4 input matrix filled with 'Alfa', the corresponding output matrix has 'India' in the first and third rows, and 'Alfa' in the second and fourth rows.

4. For a 5x6 input matrix filled with 'Alfa', the corresponding output matrix has 'India' in the first and third rows, and 'Alfa' in the second, fourth, and fifth rows.

From these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

- In the first and third rows of the output matrix, all elements are 'India'.
- In the second row of the output matrix, the first and last elements are 'India', and the middle elements are 'Alfa'.
- For the remaining rows (if any), the first and last elements are 'India', and the middle elements are the same as in the corresponding input row.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input5:

input5: 7x6

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs:

1. In input0 and output0, the 'Echo' character appears in the bottom 7 rows, and the output is a 2x2 matrix with 'Echo' in all cells.
2. In input1 and output1, the 'Charlie' character appears in the 3rd to 8th columns, and the output is a 2x2 matrix with 'Charlie' in all cells.
3. In input2 and output2, the same pattern as in input1 and output1 is observed, but with an extra row of 'Alfa' characters at the top.
4. In input3 and output3, the same pattern as in input1 and output1 is observed, but with an extra row of 'Alfa' characters at the bottom.

Now, let's consider input5:

- The 'Echo' character appears in the bottom 7 rows, similar to input0.
- The 'Charlie' character appears in the 3rd to 8th columns, similar to input1.
- There are no extra rows of 'Alfa' characters at the top or bottom, as in input2 and input3.

Based on this analysis, the output for input5 should be a 2x2 matrix with 'Echo' in all cells, as in the case of input0.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input5 is:

output5: 2x2
[[Echo, Echo],
 [Echo, Echo]]
expected: [[Echo,Echo],
[Echo,Echo]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given examples:

1. input0: 5x6 -> output0: 5x12
   The output is obtained by duplicating each row of the input, resulting in a 2x wider matrix.

2. input1: 5x7 -> output1: 5x14
   Again, the output is obtained by duplicating each row of the input, resulting in a 2x wider matrix.

3. input2: 5x8 -> output2: 5x16
   Similarly, the output is obtained by duplicating each row of the input, resulting in a 2x wider matrix.

Based on these examples, the input-to-output transformation rule is:

For a given input matrix of size nxm, the corresponding output matrix will have the same number of rows (n) and twice the number of columns (2m).

Applying this rule to the last input example:

input4: 5x9
[[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Delta,Bravo,Bravo,Delta,Bravo,Bravo,Delta,Bravo,Bravo],
[Delta,Bravo,Bravo,Delta,Bravo,Bravo,Delta,Bravo,Bravo],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa]]

The corresponding output matrix will have 5 rows and twice the number of columns (2x9 = 18):

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. Each row in the output is a copy of the input row, but with an additional copy of the row appended to the end. The number of additional copies is equal to the length of the row minus 1.

2. The appended copies are added in a cyclic manner. For example, in the first output, the second row is appended to the end of the first row, and the third row is appended to the end of the second row, creating a cyclic pattern.

Applying this rule to the last input example:

input4: 5x4
[[Echo,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Echo,Foxtrot,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Foxtrot,Golf,Alfa],
[Golf,Golf,Bravo,Alfa],

[Golf,Golf,Bravo,Alfa,Golf,Golf,Bravo,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Bravo,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Bravo]]

The transformation rule is:
1. Each row in the output is a copy of the input row, but with an additional copy of the row appended to the end. The number of additional copies is equal to the length of the row minus 1.
2. The appended copies are added in a cyclic manner.

From the given input-output pairs, we can observe the following pattern:

1. The output size is always 4x5, regardless of the input size.
2. The first row of the output is always the same as the first row of the input.
3. The second row of the output contains the first occurrence of each unique letter in the second row of the input, in the order they appear.
4. The third row of the output contains the first occurrence of each unique letter in the third row of the input, in the order they appear.
5. The fourth row of the output is the same as the first row of the output.

Applying this transformation rule to the last input example (input4):

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output size is always 3x3, regardless of the input size.
2. In the output, the 'India' character always appears in the top-left corner.
3. The rest of the output is filled with the 'Alfa' character, except for one cell in the second row and third column, which contains the 'India' character.
4. The position of the 'India' character in the second row and third column seems to be related to the position of the 'India' characters in the last row of the input.

Let's examine the last row of the input for each example:

- input0: 'Alfa', 'Foxtrot', 'Foxtrot', 'Foxtrot', 'Foxtrot', 'Alfa'
- input1: 'Alfa', 'Foxtrot', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'Alfa'
- input2: 'Alfa', 'Foxtrot', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'Alfa'
- input3: 'Alfa', 'Foxtrot', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'Alfa'
- input4: 'Alfa', 'Foxtrot', 'India', 'India', 'Foxtrot', 'Alfa'
- input5: 'Alfa', 'Foxtrot', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'Foxtrot', 'Alfa'

In the output, the 'India' character in the second row and third column corresponds to the second 'India' character from the left in the last row of the input.

Applying this rule to the last input example (input7):

The last row of input7: 'Alfa', 'Foxtrot', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'India', 'Alfa'

The second 'India' character from the left in the last row is the fourth 'India' (index 3).

Therefore, the output for input7 should be:

[[India, Alfa, Alfa],
 [Alfa, Alfa, Alfa],
 [Alfa, Alfa, Alfa]]

This output matches the pattern observed in the previous examples, confirming the deduced transformation rule.
expected: [[India,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa]]

Output2:
[[Hotel,Hotel,Charlie,Charlie,Charlie,Charlie],
 [Charlie,Hotel,Charlie,Hotel,Hotel,Hotel],
 [Hotel,Charlie,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie,Hotel]]

Observations:
1. "Golf" is replaced by "Charlie".
2. When there are two consecutive "Golf"s, they are replaced by two consecutive "Charlie"s.
3. "Hotel" remains unchanged.
4. The pattern is repeated cyclically.

Based on the observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. Replace "Golf" with "Charlie".
2. Replace two consecutive "Golf"s with two consecutive "Charlie"s.
3. "Hotel" remains unchanged.

Now, let's apply this rule to the given input4:

Input4:
[[Golf,Hotel,Hotel,Golf],

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[Charlie,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],
 [Charlie,Hotel,Charlie,Hotel],
 [Hotel,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],
 [Hotel,Charlie,Hotel,Charlie]]
expected: [[Charlie,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],
[Charlie,Hotel,Charlie,Hotel],
[Hotel,Hotel,Hotel,Charlie],
[Hotel,Charlie,Hotel,Charlie]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the given input-output pairs.

For input0:
- The input is a 6x6 matrix.
- The output is a 2x2 matrix.
- The output matrix contains the first and last elements of each row of the input matrix.

For input1:
- The input is an 8x8 matrix.
- The output is a 2x2 matrix.
- The output matrix contains the first and last elements of each row of the input matrix.

For input2:
- The input is a 12x6 matrix.
- The output is a 2x2 matrix.
- The output matrix contains the first and last elements of each row of the input matrix.

Based on the pattern observed, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

1. Take the input matrix.
2. For each row in the input matrix, select the first and last elements.
3. Arrange these selected elements in a 2x2 matrix, where the first element of each row comes from the first element of the corresponding row in the input matrix, and the second element of each row comes from the last element of the corresponding row in the input matrix.

Applying this rule to input4:

Input4: 4x8 matrix
[[Juliett, Golf, Charlie, Juliett, Juliett, Charlie, Golf, Juliett],
 [Charlie, Juliett, Juliett, Golf, Golf, Juliett, Juliett, Charlie],
 [Golf, Juliett, Juliett, Charlie, Charlie, Juliett, Juliett, Golf],
 [Juliett, Charlie, Golf, Juliett, Juliett, Golf, Charlie, Juliett]]

Output4: 2x2 matrix
[[Juliett, Golf],
 [Charlie, Juliett]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:
[[Juliett, Golf],
 [Charlie, Juliett]]
expected: [[Juliett,Golf],
[Charlie,Juliett]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

Observations:
1. The output always has 3 rows and 6 columns.
2. The first and third rows of the output contain the character 'Delta' followed by 'Alfa' characters.
3. The second row of the output contains only 'Alfa' characters.
4. The fourth row of the output contains 'Bravo' characters alternating with 'Alfa' characters.

Now, let's apply these observations to the last input example (input8):

input8: 10x9
[[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Charlie,Charlie,Charlie],
[Alfa,Charlie,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Charlie,Alfa],
[Charlie,Charlie,Charlie,Alfa,Alfa,Charlie,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],

[Charlie,Charlie,Charlie,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Charlie,Alfa,Alfa,Charlie,Charlie,Charlie,Alfa,Alfa],
[Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Charlie,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa]]

Applying the observations:
1. The output will have 3 rows and 6 columns.
2. The first and third rows will start with 'Delta' followed by 'Alfa' characters.
3. The second row will contain only 'Alfa' characters.
4. The fourth row will contain 'Bravo' characters alternating with 'Alfa' characters.

Output for input8:
[[Delta,Alfa,Delta,Bravo,Alfa,Bravo],
 [Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
 [Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Bravo,Alfa,Bravo]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8 is:
[[Delta,Alfa,Delta,Bravo,Alfa,Bravo],
 [Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa,Alfa],
 [Delta,Alfa,Alfa,Bravo,Alfa,Bravo]]
expected: [[Delta,Alfa,Delta,Bravo,Alfa,Bravo],

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

1. Input0: 12x12, Output0: 4x1
   - The output has 4 rows, which is 1/3 of the input's height (12).
   - Each output row contains only the first element (Alfa) from every 3rd row of the input.

2. Input1: 3x3, Output1: 2x1
   - The output has 2 rows, which is 2/3 of the input's height (3).
   - Each output row contains only the first element (Alfa) from every 2nd row of the input.

3. Input2: 7x7, Output2: 3x1
   - The output has 3 rows, which is 3/7 of the input's height (7).
   - Each output row contains only the first element (Alfa) from every 3rd row of the input.

4. Input3: 9x12, Output3: 5x1
   - The output has 5 rows, which is 1/9 * 5 = 5/9 of the input's height (9).
   - Each output row contains only the first element (Alfa) from every 9/5 = 1.8th row of the input.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following transformation rule:

- The number of rows in the output is (1/n) * m, where n is the input's height and m is the number of rows in the output.
- Each output row contains only the first element (Alfa) from every (input's height / output's height)th row of the input.

Now, let's apply this rule to the last input example:

Input5: 9x10

- The input's height is 9.
- To find the number of rows in the output, we can use the formula (1/n) * m, where n is the input's height (9) and m is the number of rows in the output.
- Since the input's height is 9, we can try different values of m (1, 2, 3,...) and see which one gives a whole number when divided by 9.

Let's try m = 1:
(1/9) * 1 = 1/9 ≈ 0.111
This is not a whole number, so m = 1 is not a valid option.

Let's try m = 2:
(1/9) * 2 = 2/9 ≈ 0.222
This is not a whole number, so m = 2 is not a valid option.

Let's try m = 3:
(1/9) * 3 = 3/9 = 1/3 ≈ 0.333
This is a whole number, so m = 3 is a valid option.

Therefore, the output for input5 should have 3 rows.

Now, let's determine which rows of the input are selected for each output row:

- The first output row should contain the first element (Alfa) from every (9/3) = 3rd row of the input.
- The second output row should contain the first element (Alfa) from every (9/3) = 3rd row of the input, starting from the second row.
- The third output row should contain the first element (Alfa) from every (9/3) = 3rd row of the input, starting from the third row.

Following this pattern, the output for input5 is:

Output5: 3x1
[[Alfa],
 [Alfa],
 [Alfa]]
expected: [[Alfa],
[Alfa],
[Alfa]]

output: To find the input-to-output transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

For each input, we can observe the following:
1. The first and last elements of each row in the output are the same as the corresponding elements in the input.
2. The middle elements (excluding the first and last) in each row of the output alternate between the input element and the element from the other row of the same column.

Applying this rule to the last input example:

input3: 2x6
[[Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf,Golf],
[Charlie,Charlie,Charlie,Charlie,Charlie,Charlie]]

output3: 2x6
[[Golf,Charlie,Golf,Charlie,Golf,Charlie],
[Charlie,Golf,Charlie,Golf,Charlie,Golf]]

Therefore, the corresponding output for the given input3 is:

output3: 2x6
[[Golf,Charlie,Golf,Charlie,Golf,Charlie],
[Charlie,Golf,Charlie,Golf,Charlie,Golf]]
expected: [[Golf,Charlie,Golf,Charlie,Golf,Charlie],
